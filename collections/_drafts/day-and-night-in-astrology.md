Day and night is the duality we perhaps observe the most and it certainly has a solid set of correspondences in the astrological foundational knowledge.

Getting a better understanding of astrology often starts with noticing how polarity and harmony play the music of the configuration of celestial bodies.

## Day & Night or rather Nychthemeron

The English language doesn’t have a word for the 24-hour cycle consisting of the two phases of light and darkness. Other languages do have a special word for that unit of time. The Greek word “nychtemeron” is often used to express the full cycle of day and night. It’s a funky word yet useful to keep in memory for those special occasions.

## Action and rest, diurnal and nocturnal

The day and night phases describe not only presence or absence of light, they also symbolise action and rest. Time itself is divided into alternating phases some of which are beneficial for action, others for internalisation.

This inherent dualism is being well expressed by the symbolism of the celestial bodies.

The Sun is obviously diurnal. It is a direct source of the principles of heat of action.

The Moon doesn’t emanate any light by itself but reflects it. The Moon is a nocturnal luminary with predisposition for rest and moisture. 

Jupiter relates to the Sun and therefore it’s diurnal.

Venus relates to the Moon and is nocturnal.

It’s also worth remembering the gender principle allocated to the planets: The Sun and Jupiter are masculine; The Moon and Venus are feminine.

Mercury being transgender (read post ["Masculine, feminine and transgender in astrology"]({% post_url 2018-09-28-masculine-feminine-transgender-in-astrology %})) constantly oscillates between diurnal and nocturnal. It’s considered diurnal when is above the earth when the Sun rises, and nocturnal when sets after the Sun.

## How to allocate Saturn and Mars?

Saturn is a planet of “coldness”. Mars is a planet of “dryness”.

Using the principle of balancing the opposites, it could be suggested that the coldness of Saturn needs to counterbalance the heat of the day. Thus Saturn is considered to be of a diurnal quality.

Mars with its dryness opposes moisture of the night. Thus Mars is a nocturnal planet.

It is worth noting that this is classical Ptolemy’s view. One may also argue that Mars stands for action and fits the day much better, and Saturn is mostly being depicted as an old man fitting the image of the night really well.

Such an approach would add “coldness” to “moist” of the night and “dryness” to “heat” of the day. Could it be that this would take the opposing forces out of balance? It’s an interesting question to ponder upon.

## Putting it all together

Using Ptolemy’s view the summary may look like so:

|---+---|
| Planet | Time quality | Gender
|-|-|
| The Sun | Diurnal | Masculine
| The Moon | Nocturnal | Feminine
| Mercury | Diurnal-Nocturnal | Transgender
| Venus | Nocturnal | Feminine
| Mars | Nocturnal | Masculine
| Jupiter | Diurnal | Masculine
| Saturn | Diurnal | Masculine
