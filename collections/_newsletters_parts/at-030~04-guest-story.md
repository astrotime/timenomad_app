Do you have **big plans for 2020**? Or maybe your grand plan is to actually _“stop and smell the roses”_? Whatever your intentions are you have to connect to your inner resources by forming powerful alliances that will help facilitate your manifesting process.

**All manifestations come in cycles** that are defined by starting and ending points. The great and practical example would be the Moon cycle that lasts 29.5 days. Being a relatively short cycle it’s well suited for planning and execution of concrete short-term projects.

It’s always a good idea to **synchronise your rhythms with natural cycles** – that’s how you accelerate manifestation of your intentions. The Moon’s energy is great for setting the framework of the cycle – setting your goals at New Moon and reaching its peak potential at Full Moon. Yet to actually manifest things in the physical world we need a good amount of help from the so-called **“structured” planets like the Sun, Mars and Saturn**.

Gemstones and metals can become your mighty connectors to these potent planetary forces. **Some minerals anchor Sun, Mars and Saturn archetypes better than others.** All these crystals and metals have one thing in common – their energies are of Projective nature (revisit the article about [Projective and Receptive gemstones](https://gemsinstyle.com/blogs/news/duality-that-creates-wholeness-magic-of-receptive-and-projective-gemstones){: target="_blank"}). Projective gemstones bring momentum to your action, help to overcome inertia and engage your conscious mind.

These planets and related gemstones are the best facilitators of your manifesting power:

* **Sun** archetype will boost your self-actualisation and self-esteem. Seek support from **Gold, Tiger Eye, Ruby, Carnelian, Citrine**.

* **Mars** will dymanise your action and stimulate your ambitions. Corresponding minerals are **Iron, Hematite, Pyrite, Garnet, Lava stone, Bloodstone**.

* **Saturn** will support your self-discipline and focus on practicalities with a help from **Lead, Lapis Lazuli, Blue Sapphire**.

[Rutilated Quartz](https://gemsinstyle.com/collections/dancing-orbit/products/dancing-orbit-rutilated-quartz){: target="_blank"} is a perfect crystal that exhibits the Sun–Mars dialectic: the power of active self-manifestation through personal will and action.

**The gemstone power is waiting.** The rest is up to you...
