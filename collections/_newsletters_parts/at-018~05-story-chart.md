The regal month of August enjoys the long-awaited Sun–Venus conjunction that promises to gift us with the feelings of love and harmony richly supported by the **Sun travelling through its own sign, Leo** the king of all animals.

But, love or not… **Venus is a passionate and hot “pressure cooker” planet**, one shouldn’t rush to paint it pink and oversimplify its mighty potential. Powered by the exalted Sun energy Venus may equally manifest itself as the **force of vanity and indulgence**, especially knowing that it is still in square with often tense and abrupt Uranus until August 7 — pretty much until the moment of its exact conjunction with the Sun.

The second part of Sun–Venus conjunction will introduce direct heat of martian fire through its developing conjunction with Mars. **Will it be love or passionate disagreement?** Knowing Mars–Venus dynamics it’s healthy to keep all options open.

That triple conjunction influences all of the second part of August and “travels” well into September beginning with the New Moon on August 30 that will be a bit of a doppelgänger since the **Black Moon is in force during that moment** — exponentiated by the Moon making its closest approach to the Earth (perigee).

**August is the month of ripening**, the whole world and each of us is busy growing what is important and vital. It’s the time best devoted to diligent implementation and care for what has been already planted — _we all desire a good harvest!_
