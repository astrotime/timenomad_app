Exacting **Venus – Jupiter conjunction** will have an additional effect as the passing Moon will form a grand trine connecting this aspect to Mars. 

Pretty much **each planet of this formation** is in its **favourable sign**: Mars is in Aries, Jupiter in Sagittarius. Venus feels okay in Sagittarius, being in dignity. The Moon may be somewhat “overheated” by being in Leo, traditionally ruled by the Sun.

This trine may work in rather interesting ways. On one hand **grand trines are harmonious** and help flow of energies. On the other hand most of the planets are at the their **“peak” performance moments**. Bear in mind that Mars – Venus is a passionate couple!

It will be good to spare the Moon, the sphere of inner feelings and keep it cool during that day.
