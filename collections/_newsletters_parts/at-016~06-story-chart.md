July lunar cycle promises to be an important period characterised by Uranian flavour alongside with potent energies of the Sun and Mars blasting their way forward:

* **Saturn** on the South Node, July 4
* the **Sun** on the North Node, July 9
* **Mars** square **Uranus**, July 11
* **Mercury** retrograde, July 7–31

The New Moon’s chart looks simple and almost symmetrical yet it clearly passes a sense of surprising and unexpected possibilities.

Several planets form a square with Uranus during July, most notably Mars and the Sun. A **Sun–Uranus square brings great ideas** and introduces revolutionary concepts while **Mars–Uranus is often seen as a recipe for blind violence** and letting wild forces spin out of control. 

The **sesquisquare “spike”** (or sometimes “yod”) aspect pattern pointing at both Mars and Mercury is another important point of interest. We are discussing this kind of aspect formation in the current featured story [“Aspect patterns — the building blocks of astrological charts”](/posts/astrology/philosophy/2019/07/01/aspect-patterns-building-blocks-of-charts.html).

### Jupiter square Neptune

Jupiter–Neptune square is a longer influence that began on April 8 and completes on October 30. The two moments when square becomes exact are:

* June 16 with Jupiter retrograde
* September 21 with Neptune retrograde

Jupiter aspects to Neptune are usually beneficial, both planets welcome **bigness and universality**. There is a risk though: while dealing with anything really big, one **can become utterly out of touch with reality**. Having a good degree of **Saturnian prudence** is always a welcome addition in this configuration!
