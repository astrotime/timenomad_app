Mars and Regulus go together well. Regulus is a triple fixed star, it’s the main star in the constellation of Leo. Regulus is predominantly of Mars nature with some Jupiterian tones. 

**Mars is exactly conjunct Regulus on August 18.** Both celestial bodies relate to violence and military pursuit. On the positive side they both bring strength, success and ambition. 

We can expect actions of military nature or acts that bring public prominence and reflect strong personality. Mark this day in your calendar and see where astrological energies will take you and the larger world around us.

### What to do with passionate Mars–Venus?

Exercise! **Complex problems sometimes do have simple solutions.** Mars–Venus balance controls the flow of libido and life force in general. One may take the notion of libido further than its standard “sexual drive” connotation into a more broader notion of “ability to want”. And that’s what Mars and Venus are about. They want each other, they want things, they want experiences. 

Mars and Venus is an eternal polarity that resolves itself either through a **fiery combustion or through an engaging flow**. The secret of handling Mars–Venus inflammation can be discovered by engaging in a vigorous physical exercise that miraculously equalises the forces and achieves peace through exertion.

### Preparing for the New Moon on perigee

The month of August culminates with the **New Moon at its closest distance to the Earth**, or perigee. 

The second half of August is the period of possibly **increasing martian influences** that will plant seeds for the near future. 

The New Moon on its perigee activates the Black Moon through the power of its opposition. It is a great time for some in-depth observations of what really moves us and what limits us. The earlier story [“In the “shadow” of the Black Moon”](https://timenomad.app/posts/astrology/philosophy/2019/07/31/the-shadow-of-the-black-moon.html)
casts some astrological light onto the mysteries of the Black Moon.
