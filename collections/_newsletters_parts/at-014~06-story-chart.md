The current chart is not defined by contradictions, quite the opposite, the **planets are mostly talking to each other**. Yet there is a certain need for caution: **don’t make judgements too quickly**, there are things **out of our control** and they may remind us of their existence. It’s vital to **tap from joyous and optimistic** energies on our way through this lunar month.

Let’s look into what it all means…

### Mars on the North Node

**The North Node is about the future**, it’s the point at which the Moon surfaces from below the southern half of the ecliptic. The node is the metaphor for the things to come. **Mars is the planet of dynamism that loves to achieve** and goes well with the direction of the North Node, especially when it nicely coincides with the new beginnings of the New Moon.

There is little doubt that there will be **challenges and obstacles as indicated by Saturn and Pluto** on the South Node and actively opposing the Marsian impetus. Luckily Saturn’s is retrograde movement should soothe its often overly cautious if not outwardly negative traits.

A good attitude this time is to **positively accept challenges** and match them with the force of enthusiasm, something that Jupiter is so full of!

### The New Moon at the time of Jupiter retrograde

Naturally **ambitious Jupiter is still somewhat limited by its retrograde** movement that will last for another nine weeks until **August 11**.

This means that the success of the June Moon cycle largely depends on getting as much of Jupiterian energy as possible during the New Moon. 

Luckily we have **Neptune to the rescue**. Neptune and Jupiter is a great match in heavens from the perspective of **devotion, faith and idealistic vision**. Neptune square is a manifesting aspect and it may **channel some inspiring ideas** that will compensate the retrograde effect of Jupiter’s movement.

### Fixed star Aldebaran warms up the New Moon

While in the tropical Zodiac system the New Moon takes place in Gemini, **the real night sky shows a different picture…** with a disclaimer that one won’t be able to see the New Moon since it’s a Sun–Moon conjunction and thus invisible during the day. 

**The Moon** is actually squarely in the **constellation of Taurus** and positioned **exactly conjunct to Aldebaran** just four hours before the New Moon moment. Aldebaran is a reddish star radiating energies akin to a combined nature of Mars, Mercury and Jupiter, it projects a **good degree of warmth and generally works well with the Moon**. The trick is to **not get overly aroused by its Mars component** while being receptive to the **Jupiterian expansive energies** contained within its pale rose light.
