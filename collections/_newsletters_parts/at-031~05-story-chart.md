title: The Black Moon and Chiron — when healing is needed
---

One can’t truly aspire to move forward without first resolving their past. And the past is something **we are designed to forget**. This last lunation happens under the influence of the Black Moon–Chiron conjunction, and will culminate during the next New Moon with the Sun and the Moon joining their forces and producing a powerful cluster of four planets square to the lunar nodes. All that in the **fiery sign of Aries**.

**How to better understand this cosmic puzzle?**

The Black Moon stands for the **hidden, often disowned,** side of us. It’s what we become when we **lose conscious control** of our own behaviour. Will we become manic lovers or fearless machinators? That’s the personal shadow to be discovered and accepted. Black Moon is a great topic, to learn more read [“In the ‘shadow’ of the Black Moon”](https://timenomad.app/posts/astrology/philosophy/2019/07/31/the-shadow-of-the-black-moon.html){: target="_blank"}

In any case, what truly moves that shadow is often that kind of **prior experiences that resulted in hurt, misunderstanding, abandonment…** you name it. Those events leave lasting imprints in our astral bodies, not unlike wounds that scar the flesh. Chiron is the principle of **resolution and healing**, it symbolises the process of experiencing and accepting what has happened — without that no future movement is possible.

Those lunations during which Chiron finds itself close to the Black Moon — happens roughly about **every 9 years** — is an important time period offering a window of opportunity that may bring that resolution. The next conjunction **will only happen in November 2029**.

Zooming out from the personal arena to **the whole world**. What stands out is the **world’s health**: now we have the **coronavirus problem** that may become a fertile ground that will reveal the even bigger systemic weakness — the **world’s financial debt**. I’ve recently read that economically savvy people are now nearly equally divided into two camps: one half of them says the **pandemic won’t happen** and it’s not different from regular flu outbreaks, the other half treats coronavirus threat very seriously and already started to **stock canned food**. 

That’s fascinating stuff to watch from an astrological perspective. All seeds have already been sawn, what will emerge?
