The **Sun – Neptune conjunction** is a big and beautiful event in its own right that happens once a year around the first week of March.

The Sun stands for **the core and the source of all energy** in both Solar System and every individual.

The energy of Neptune represents a **vast and endless universal ocean-like union** of everything and everyone. Neptune gears into dreams and idealism, equally brings grandeur to dreams and delusions.

The Sun has just begun powering this endless source of everything unreal and will be pouring more and more of its energy in the coming seven days.

It is a good time to look at your **inner idealist** and aspire for everything that is **lofty and out of this world**. Your aspirations may be heard, it’s a very special time window, especially given that that is **the day of the New Moon** as well!
