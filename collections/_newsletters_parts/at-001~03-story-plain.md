Celestial events that grace our skies this week:
 
#### The Full Moon eclipsed by the Earth on January, 21

The fullness of the Sun energy will be somewhat blocked by the shadow to the Earth on its way to the Moon. Consider taking that day at 50% of your capacity, not all energy will be available for personal progress.

#### Venus â€“ Jupiter conjunction on January, 22

An excellent event. Both lucky planets, both tap from the source of creativity. Good time for making things big, the celestial couple will facilitate bringing your creative projects to fruition.
