In human history as well as in the domain of inner alchemy there are four very special metals — **gold, silver, iron and copper**.

Humanity intimately knew and used them since ancient times because people were able to extract these elements from Mother Earth with **bare hands and simple tools**.

Interestingly, these metals are the metaphysical representations of the four celestial bodies closest to our planet — the Sun, the Moon, Mars and Venus. They are **the essences of Astral Forces**, the manifestation of universal powers that actively interact with our consciousness and affect our well-being in profound ways.

These four metals relate to the four major Planetary Energies:

|---+---|
| Metal | Planet
|-|
| Gold | the Sun
| Silver | the Moon
| Copper | Venus
| Iron | Mars

Did you notice that the list also contains **the most profound polarities** of planetary energies? 

The Sun energy is the opposite of the Moon, and Mars is antipodal to Venus. **The right balance of these polarities in our energies is extremely essential.** It defines our ability to give and receive, to achieve and manifest abundance in life in a way that is meaningful to us.

How to **enhance your life performance** by activating Projective (Sun and Mars) and Receptive (Moon and Venus) Planetary Energies through corresponding metals?

How metals — the essential planetary “ambassadors” — can **support your career, relationships and well-being?**

And much much more… we will discuss in two weeks’s time in our next Newsletter and my new blog post.
