As an addition to what the _Featured Story_ passed about **Neptunian challenges**, I wanted to share a true story that has just happened and actually **coincided** with the current Sun – Neptune conjunction.
 
On the 3rd of March Bloomberg published an article **“Square Inc. Co-Founder Tristan O’Tierney Dies at 35”** reporting an untimely death of a **young and successful** tech entrepreneur. 

We will never know what was the psychological landscape of Tristan for the last few years while he was battling **his Neptunian addiction to substance abuse**. But here is somebody else’s comment to the article that really passes **wide swings between intoxication and idealism** so characteristic for Neptune:

> Last year, at age 35, I started drinking heavily. I would buy a bottle of Absolute and would not stop till I see the bottom of it. 2 bottles a week at min. About 5-6 months, I've stopped drinking without anyone's help.  
> Yesterday and today, I'm having a strong urge to get completely wasted. Just go to the store around the block, buy bottle of Absolute.  
> Yesterday, while driving on I-695, I saw a guy with a child seat on the back seat and thought to myself: “I want that too”.

Notice how the ideal of having a kid sparked his Neptunian part? That’s why Neptune can be so challenging, **one day you want to dissolve, another day you want to share love**, and then what if later on you will want to dissolve again… that’s can get dramatic.
