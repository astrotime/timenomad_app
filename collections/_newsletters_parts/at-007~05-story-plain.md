The annual **Sun – Neptune conjunction** happened on the **6th of March** at 7:59 PM (EST), or **9 hours after the New Moon** took place in tropical **Pisces**.

There is a **rich symbolism** in this event:

* the end of the Moon cycle
* the end of the Sun – Neptune annual cycle
* takes place in Pisces, the last sign of the Zodiac

**Jupiter**, the planet of **expansion and optimism**, that is currently positioned in its own sign of Sagittarius, will receive an extra energy boost from this event through the **Sun – Jupiter square** that will be growing in strength till the culmination on March, 13. 

This is an auspicious time to **use the emptiness** and **reset yourself** towards a bigger and broader trajectory using the **fire of the Sun** and **idealism of Neptune** that will push your **inner “guru” of Jupiter**. An event not to be missed. Figure out what rituals you may want to perform, **every small act of aspiration** and asking for more will be counted.
