Let’s talk about **White**…

In nature white colour in its pure form is very rare among gemstones. Actually **opaque white doesn’t exist at all with only one exception…**

This exception is **Howlite — a semi precious gemstone of white colour** with veins of other minerals running through it. Someone may say it’s reminiscent of white marble — however marble is not used in jewellery, so we will leave it aside for now.

We love Howlite for its graceful elegance and purifying simplicity. Howlite is **associated with Crown chakra** (mind and thoughts) and known for its ability to calm overactive mind and release stresses of all kinds. Well, honestly who doesn’t need it these days?
Howlite is like a _quintessence from “celestial highness”_, a **touch of angelic presence** if you wish. Astrologically speaking, it doesn’t correspond to any particular planetary energy — **it rather unites all the planetary energies** in one celestial principle and connects us to purity and harmony.
