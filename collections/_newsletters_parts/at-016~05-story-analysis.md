Every astrologically minded person is likely to have noticed by now that we live in the **world that is morphing at the speed not seen before**. Societies and economies are experiencing the period of disruptions and structural changes. As if caught unawares, we don’t quite know what to think about the world of tomorrow apart from the common observation that we are flying along the trajectory that is **exiting the post-WWII era of stability and social justice**.

The strongest of all economies, the US, is beginning to expose its Achilles’ heel — the **financial system** that over last two-three decades gradually morphed into a machine exclusively **focused on generating short-term profits** in the name of shareholders’ return on investment. The shift took us from the era of industrial productivity to the **era of wealth redistribution and profit extraction** where the economy is growing by the means of ever increasing outsourcing of production to cheaper labour markets.

This kind of economic growth is only sustainable for a certain period of time since resources on Earth are limited. When one chops trees in the forest faster than new trees grow, it doesn’t really matter how big the forest was, **such approach has a finite life span**.

Current passage of **Saturn through the Dragon’s Tail** on July 4 and the Sun’s passage through the Dragon’s Head on July 9 mark the beginning of a new phase of this process that will result in further disruptions since the underlying problems haven’t been addressed properly and thoroughly. 

Recent news updates from G20 meeting of world leaders gave us some semblance of hope that the spirit of international cooperation will prevail. But we are still far from being certain that forces profiting from destabilisation have been quieted. Approaching **squares to Uranus point at possibilities of technological conflicts, both armed and economical** that may spring from hot-headed disagreements.

Some recent developments illustrate this point really well:

* The **situation with Iran remains extremely fragile** and military conflict is still a sad possibility. Recent strikes carried out by Israel against Syria is another pointer at brewing hostilities.

* **Hong Kong unrest** spins out of reasonable proportions towards an outright “revolutionary” behaviour of hot headed masses. So much of Uranus in that!

We may witness some mounting circumstances in the months of July and August leading up to the September Equinox. This period provides a precious **opportunity for astrological analysis and prediction**. Upcoming events are likely to be related to **projection of influence if not outright force**. The **money factor** may start emerging closer to the last quarter of the year.
