**Sometimes things are not what they seem…** You may have learned this by being interested in astrology or maybe even seriously practicing this discipline, right? This also applies to gemstones. The way they’ve been treated or modified to enhance their visual properties and value may create an interference with their natural energetic profile.

So what do you need to be **aware of when buying crystals**, gemstones or any gemstone jewellery with an intention to tune into a connection with planetary energies that each of them carries?

**Colour must be natural — stay away from dyed gemstones.**

Enhancing or even changing gemstone colour is a very common practice especially when it comes to jewellery. Gem sellers are expected to disclose any treatment a natural stone may have undergone in order to increase its value (in addition to the standard cutting and polishing process). Unfortunately the reality is not there yet.

So when you go for crystal shopping simply ask the seller: **_Has this gemstone been treated and if so, how exactly?_** And then decide for yourself if you want to proceed.

To improve their colour and clarity gemstones can go through **dyeing, bleaching, heat treatment, surface coating, irradiation, oiling and reconstruction**. 

Some of these treatments are more “confusing” than others when it comes to planetary energies. 

Colour acts as a **key to the gemstone’s personality and forces** it is connected to. When the colour is significantly altered or changed (especially with chemicals) the energy and connection to the related planetary forces may easily vanish.
