If this Full Moon is so fiery that’s due to some recent and still developing passages:

* The **Moon** has just completed its close passage to the star **Regulus**
* **Mars** is completing its conjunction with the fiery star **Aldebaran**
* The **Sun** is heating up Uranus culminating in an exact conjunction shortly after the **Full Moon**

Looking at the chart for **19 April 2019** depicting the moment of the Full Moon…

The **Moon swung past Regulus** a few days ago on April 15, an event that has, with little doubt, contributed to [the fire of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris](/posts/astrology/event/2019/04/15/influence-of-fixed-stars-case-of-notre-dame-fire.html). The encounter with Regulus filled the Moon with the **energies of Sun, Uranus and Mars**. Regulus is known as both the **“Lion’s heart”** and the **“Crushing Foot”**. Pick the one you prefer the most!

**Mars stayed conjunct** with the beautiful star **Aldebaran** (the constellation of Taurus) from April 10 to April 19. Aldebaran is a **predominantly Marsian star** with some undertones of Mercury and Jupiter. 

It’s always good to remember that any planet **conjunct to Aldebaran is opposite to Antares**, an even more Marsian star located in the constellation of Scorpius, you’re starting to get the full picture! One may meaningfully speak of the **Aldebaran–Antares axis of fire**.

The **Sun** is continuing to **irradiate already electric Uranus** on their way to **exact conjunction on April 22**. 

And, of course, we can’t forget our **favourite of the year** — [the ongoing grinder of Saturn – Pluto conjunction](/posts/astrology/event/2018/12/22/saturn-pluto-conjunction-year-2019.html) is about to **turn retrograde** very soon. Pluto goes fist on April 24 closely followed by Saturn on April 29. Only a few sleeps left! This retrograde isn’t necessarily going to be a “bad” thing. **It may bring some pressure relief**, we’ll know soon anyway.

To wrap up the big picture, it’s a **fiery period of time prone to bursts and accidents** relating to unconfined fire of possibly electric and unexpected nature. Stay wise knowing that any **surprises are part of the celestial plan**!
