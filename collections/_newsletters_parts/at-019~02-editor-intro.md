This last **Full Moon in the sign of Leo** couldn’t bring us fewer passionate surprises! One may have hoped that having the Sun–Venus conjunction helps to soften the extremes, alas, the Full Moon is happening at the time when Sun–Venus is also in the process of **tightening its conjunction with Mars**, the planet of energy and action.

Combative nature of Mars can be clearly observed in both personal situations and on the world scene. **The Moon’s fullness further amplifies all sorts of conflicts and polarity of interests.** One may found themselves arguing and fearlessly defending one’s position and territory. Those are all signs of overwhelming emotional pressure in the domain of passion and individuality. What are good strategies during the second half of this lunation? We shall discuss them further down the page.

**The world scene provides some vivid illustrations of Mars–Venus** overheated by the fire of the Sun. Civil unrest turned outright violence in Hong Kong, stabbing attack in Sydney, Australia, clashes of protesters and police in Moscow, Russia. All those events tell us of passions went extreme. Mars is capable of coarse and cruel acts that Venus can at times surprisingly exaggerate through its frivolous nature. Looking at the economy at large, there is an increasing risk of it gradually sliding into recession due to unresolved conflictual attitudes between key players.

There is a degree of hope with the Sun–Mars–Venus trio leaving the fiery sign of Leo and moving into Virgo after August 23. **Virgo may bring some prudence and the sense of duty** as well as consideration of interests of others. That would be a very welcome development! We shall look into some more astrological details for the second part of August in _Astrological Weather_ down below.
