Writing this just a few hours before the **New Moon of April, 5** and enjoying the deep silence of the last dark hours that precede the New Moon moment that is a hair-thin **borderline between the old and the new**, the completion of the last 29Â½ days long lunar cycle.

This New Moon is nearly perfectly coincides with **Pluto conjunction with the South Lunar Node**, taking everything Moon related even further down into the darkness from which all things have originated.

The time of the New Moon is a perfect opportunity to talk about the **magic of the Equinox and its connection with the idea of universal consciousness**. The featured story below will attempt to convey some important knowledge about Equinoxes and Solstices and how to use those special moments to align with the universal flow of time.

Right now we are entering an important **period that is directly related to the nodes of the Moon** and some interesting effects that this alignment may produces. Scroll down to the _Upcoming Astrological Events_ for more details.

Crossing the fine line,<br>
