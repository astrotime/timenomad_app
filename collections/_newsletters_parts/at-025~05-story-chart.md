The word “magnificence” can be equally applied to both Venus and Jupiter. As a pair of **“diamonds” in the sky, both planets are the brightest and the most joyous of all celestial bodies**. Jupiter shines its boundless magnanimity while Venus sparkles with its heavenly perfection.

When together, Jupiter and Venus gift us with **the powers of creativity** upheld by eternal bouyancy of optimism and joy. Their archetypes are those of the Greek gods Zeus and Aphrodite, arguably the two most adored (for different reasons) characters of the Greek pantheon. Who doesn’t want to be either **the most powerful or the most beautiful?** Deep inside we all do, yet there is always a catch and a lesson to be learned. Extremes need to be handled well.

Our story [“An archetype of love triangle, or why Jupiter and Venus always in love”](/posts/astrology/interpretation/2019/01/28/love-triangle-of-jupiter-venus.html){: target="_blank"} looks deeper into the mythology behind these powerhouses of attraction and some of its reflections in the world down below.

A Venus–Jupiter conjunction brings an excellent opportunity for those with **artistic and creative minds**, spiritual aspiration or other lofty predispositions. On the earthly plane, the conjunction may result in **certain excesses and over-indulgence** in sensuality or passion for affairs.

Whichever path you will choose, the two diamonds will be shining bright in the sky just **two days before the following New Moon** thus giving us a perfect wrap up for the current lunar cycle that is in its full bloom right now.
