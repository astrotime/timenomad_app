The autumn equinox (in the Northern Hemisphere) happens shorty after the Last Quarter of this lunation and falls on September 23. **The Moon’s position is quite auspicious** since it’s aligned with its North Node in Cancer setting future trajectory toward the values of growth and care and away from the opposing slow grind of Saturn–Pluto conjunction.

What’s more, there is a **helpful Mercury–Venus square** that softens that Moon–Saturn–Pluto opposition. Even though square is usually seen as an aspect of challenge, it actually lends a helping hand to the Moon during this Equinox by infusing the values of harmony and creativity into the second half of the Solar cycle.

The chart is noticeably **dominated by two T-Squares**: the first of Moon–Saturn–Venus that we have just covered and the second formed by Mars, Jupiter and Neptune tightly conjunct with the Black Moon.

The second T-Square reminds us of **challenges when choosing between action and contemplation**. One can equally go dreaming big or acting big. This will impact on the future prospects big time since the crucial time of Equinox sets trends and adjusts forces that will shape not only one’s second part of the Solar cycle, the momentum will last much further into the future — just as everything that is related to the Sun’s energy, **the only true source of energy in this planetary neighbourhood**.
