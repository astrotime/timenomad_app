Talking about the current Moon phase is like a conversational ice-breaker that we astrologers know all too well. The phases of the Moon are truly the carrier of **astrological weather**, a mini-milestone season with its ever repeating 29-and-something days cycle.

We have just passed **the Last Quarter**, the final station of the Moon cycle that started 3 weeks and 2 days ago on February 4. 

The last six days — the period from the Full Moon until the current Last Quarter — were focused on **active harvesting of whatever we have sawn** during the first half  of this Moon cycle, from February 4 till February 19. 

The upcoming seven days will be the **the period of internalisation** that will last until the next New Moon that will happen on March 6.

Now we can reflect back at those last three weeks in order to remember the events that have happened and perhaps use this introspection and **plan how to wrap up this Moon cycle**.

And those were a fiery three weeks! Most notably we had **Mars – Uranus conjunction on February 13**. This event brought some ongoing sparks that materialised a few unpleasant surprises and sudden ruptures. That’s the nature of Uranus and having direct fire of Mars only adds extra TNT to the **combustible mix**.

Further down the page I will talk how the usual suspects, **Tesla and Elon Musk**, were affected by this cosmic alignment.

Personally, it would be a good idea to **aim for a peaceful period** leading up to the next New Moon. Having some degree of calm will be extra important to meet the next cosmic alignment, the **Sun – Neptune conjunction** on March 6 that will incidentally happen **on the day of the New Moon**. Scroll down for some thoughts on that.

Be in peace,<br>
