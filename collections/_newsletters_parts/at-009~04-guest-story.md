If you want to cultivate your **intuition and self-awareness**, balance your emotions and learn to see things in perspective, **seek assistance from Larimar**. This gemstone manifests the synergy of two powerful planetary forces: **Uranus and Neptune**.

**Uranus is related to the air element** — the power of futuristic vision, innovation and intuition. **Neptune rules over the water element** and manifests itself through highly idealistic values, artistic inspiration and spiritual devotion.

Larimar is associated with the elements of **both air and water** and symbolises the harmony between thoughts and emotions, your spirit and your body.

Beautifully represented by the Larimar gemstone, these two energies will guide you through the obstacles of your mind, **connect you to your feelings** and give you an unlimited **access to your intuition**.

Larimar projects its incredible **calming and soothing effect upon its wearer**, it “washes away” everything you need to let go of in order to bring new energy, integrity and true vision into your life.

Larimar is also known as the Atlantis Stone and it is believed that the discovery of this magnificent gemstone was predicted by famous American psychic **Edgar Cayce** (1877 – 1945), also known as **“The Sleeping Prophet”**.
