title: "Watch: Saturn–Pluto & Galactic Center Alignment of January 12, 2020"

I want to share this **excellently produced video that takes apart Saturn–Pluto conjunction** of 2020 and offers some thoughts for your to ponder upon. The video is made by our friend Claudio Silvaggi from _iyoutome_ who has always been an active user of Time Nomad. It’s about 24 minutes long and looks at several major alignments that accompany this rare event. As they say, “see for yourself”…
