As it was predicted in the previous issue of _Astrology Today_, last **Moon cycle was of a fiery nature** especially for the world events: both the fire of Notre-Dame and Sri Lanka bombings have been **major man-made disasters**. 

From an astrological perspective some of the contributing factors (and I believe there are several other reasons) could be seen in the **fixed stars’ influence** — both Mars and the Moon moved past the stars with prominent Mars-like influences:

* **Mars** conjunct **Aldebaran** in the constellation of Taurus
* the **Moon** conjunct **Regulus** in the constellation of Leo

… and never forget that whatever planet is conjunct to Aldebaran is automatically opposite to **Antares** — this **major fiery-red star in the constellation of Scorpius** doesn’t need much introduction, it’s perhaps the most fatal, headstrong and destructive source of astral energies. Its name means “Anti Ares” or “the rival of Ares” not for nothing!

The **New Moon of May 4** brings a much needed reset and completion of that eventful period. The next Moon cycle promises to be of somewhat different nature as it starts with a Mercury–Uranus conjunction, read more on that and **your personal strategies for this lunation** in _Upcoming Astrological Events_ down the page.

This issue is focusing on the **fixed stars and their role in astrology**. Personally I think that the fixed stars are “in charge” of many events that fall into the category of **fame and fate**. This makes them extra exciting albeit not easy subject to grasp — firstly, there is a lot of them, and, secondly, the stars are very different from the planets and we somewhat lacking the proper language to describe their influence.

The _Featured Story_ below will attempt to give a **broad overview of the nature of fixed stars**, their classification and how one could interpret their place and role in natal and mundane astrological charts.
