I know that a lot of folks patiently waited for the **fixed stars functionality** to be **added to Time Nomad**. And it has finally happened! Thank you to everybody for being patient, understanding and supporting me through the process.

Working with the fixed stars was certainly a **challenge**. Firstly, the sheer number of the stars out there required some process of singling out the most relevant ones from the astrological point of view. The 15 Behenian “root” stars are certainly the ones to start with but clearly not quite enough. 

I ended up opting for the classical work of Vivian Robson **“The Fixed Stars And Constellations In Astrology”** that was published in 1923 but still stands as the pillar of the stellar knowledge. Yes, it’s a bit old-style in its language but mostly due to the sources it uses: Ptolemy, Alvidas, Simmonite and other classical astrologers whose intimate knowledge of astrology of the stars still remains unmatched.

You have to **excuse the language of their interpretations**. My advice is do not take it literally but rather “translate” it to the modern notions. For example, nebulae were  considered a sign of physical blindness. In the modern astrological interpretation one can talk about a weakened ability to see, to discern, to know, and thus a holistic astrological advice would be working on one’s understanding, learning new things, not staying locked up in what one already knows and comfortable with.

The add-on is **designed to be freely configurable**. You can select what stars you want to work with, what stellar aspects you’re interested in and set your own orbs.

Aspects to the fixed stars is a big topic in itself. It’s a common practice to only work with conjunctions. But other aspects are also valid geometrical constructs and thus Time Nomad is not trying to limit you in any way. Choose from a wide variety of stellar aspects and see what works best for your practice.

The above [story investigating the Notre-Dame fire](/posts/astrology/event/2019/04/15/influence-of-fixed-stars-case-of-notre-dame-fire.html) is an example of the fixed stars analysis that can provide some ideas of how to use the add-on.

Lastly, the add-on isn’t fully finished yet. There are still some improvements that I am planning to make in the coming months.
