The current **Full Moon of May 18** coincides with a **creative and always unexpected Venus–Uranus conjunction** that becomes exact just 5 hours before the moment of the Full Moon. Further down the page in the _Astrological Weather_ section we will be looking into how Uranus brings some potentially surprising twists to Venusian domain of romance and relationships. A small hint: **never underestimate originality of Uranus when it comes to love affairs!**

**The second half of this Moon cycle** is going to be influenced by a couple other astrological events that may cause a certain release of unnecessary complex psychological patterns. What caught my eye is the level of involvement of this lunar cycle with the **ongoing Saturn-Pluto conjunction**. This conjunction may impact us through both feelings and reasoning. And that’s always a recipe for complexity.

What I am talking about is both the Sun–Mercury conjunction and the Sun–Moon opposition that will receive the ongoing **Saturn–Pluto conjunction grind** in a more than usual amount. Already we are witnessing a **few hints on the global political arena** that some things are moving out of whack:

* The US–China trade disagreement got worse
* The US state of Alabama passed a medieval anti-abortion law
* The situation with Iran continues to be artificially inflated by forces interested in war and conflict as opposed to negotiations
* In the UK, Theresa May is on an exiting trajectory from her PM seat

In my view, there’s a lot of **emotional confusion and lack of clear reasoning** that is influencing this lunar month. Saturn–Pluto conjunction is currently impacting both the Moon and Mercury letting things get stirred way beyond necessary.

This period presents a chart that is **rich with aspects**: lots of conjunctions, oppositions and trines. Having too much of everything makes the situation confusing and our actions may become irrational. The _Featured Story_ will look at the **power of astrological aspects** and will attempt to answer the question of why **interpretation of aspects** is the ultimate foundation of any serious astrological work.
