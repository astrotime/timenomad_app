The Moon cycle of the month of May finishes on June 3 with the **New Moon** taking place **right in the middle of the Gemini sign** of the Zodiac. Astrological nature of this event is influencing the upcoming June lunation in some prominent ways, mostly due to **significant positioning of Mars and Jupiter** at the time around the New Moon.

**Firstly, Mars** — a fast moving planet of fire, courage and anything inflammable — is rapidly moving towards its conjunction with the **power axis of 2019** — the nodes of the Moon with Saturn and Pluto both retrograde oscillating around the South Node. **Mars is due to exact conjunction with the North Node on June 12** shortly after the First Quarter on June 10. 

**Mars conjunction to one of the lunar nodes** often produces some **stimulating situations**, and I don’t mean it in a bad way! You will be able to find some more information on the topic of Mars and the North Node further down the page in the _Astrological Weather_ section. 

The tricky part of this cycle is **Mars opposition to Saturn** that will become exact only 2 days later, on June 14. Keeping in mind that the event falls in between the First Quarter and the Full Moon, one may expect a somewhat **simultaneous “push and pull”**. Which part will win? We may only guess!

Back to what makes the New Moon of June 3 extra special:

* the Moon nearly exactly **opposed to Jupiter**
* the Moon nearly exactly **square to Neptune**
* the Moon is still aligned with the **fixed star Aldebaran** in the constellation of Taurus
* the Sun, that is obviously conjunct with the Moon, is also **parallel to the South Node**

In other words, it’s a nice soup of influences:

* **drive** versus **indecision**
* **fire** that strives to find its way to the surface
* the movement of **withdrawal** while still **wanting to win**
* **ambition** yet necessity to deal with **forgotten debt**

I will attempt to say more about these forces down below. This period does require a **good degree of realism** while dealing with situations that can be not in our control regardless of what we tell ourselves. Here we have to accept that neither stubborn fighting nor entrenched denial won’t get us far. A good attitude is the one of **acceptance while not forgetting to move forward…** with certain caution and realism.

Staying real,<br>
