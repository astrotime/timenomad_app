What makes the current **Full Moon stand out and being so noticeable**, astrologically speaking? Number one, it’s the **Moon’s “vertical” position** placing it at its furthest southwards separation point from the ecliptic plane.  Number two, it’s the **Full Moon–Sun square to Pluto**. This celestial configuration brings the two luminaries in contact with the least visible, the darkest and remote planet.

As the result, the **Full Moon feels charged and challenging in hard to explain ways**. We can think about the powers of visible challenging the powers of hidden and invisible, often producing an injection of tension and unsettlement into the sphere of feelings and emotions. There isn’t many ways to avoid this irrational exposure, **the natural flow of time is the best friend that takes us away from the extremes of the unseen pressure**. Further down the page I will talk about the Moon and Pluto energies in some more details. 

The one aspect that actually helps is **current Venus–Uranus opposition**. Polarity between these two celestial gems introduces some tangible relief through **aesthetically directed curiosity and novelty**. Being spontaneous, creative and artistic is the best way to navigate around this otherwise overly pressurised Full Moon.

In my discussion of the current astrological weather further down the page I will highlight some **potentially significant dates being October 21 and 27** followed by the period culminating at **November 5 — all directly related to Mars, Pluto and Uranus**. We shall see what this period will bring to us individually and the world at large.
