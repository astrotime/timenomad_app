title: World events during May lunar month
---

Remember how in the previous issue I was writing about **“separating emotions from reason”** during the Moon–Mercury opposition? 

That didn’t go well judging by the world news. **Our politicians seem to be bent on using conflicts** as a means to an end. Yet in some strange ways it feels satisfying to see that astrology helps us to explain this strange world and its propensity for hurting itself.

The latest intensification and solidification of the **trade war between the US and China** turned a moderately brewing conflict into an open confrontation that will eventually shape this world in ways that we can’t yet foresee. Nearly all components are already there, we may just sit back and enjoy the unfoldment.

This US-China breakup is so akin to the [other passage of the previous issue](/newsletters/2019-05-17-astrology-today-issue-013.html#venus-and-uranus-eccentric-love) “Venus and Uranus: eccentric love”:

> Sudden break up of existing partnerships (and not only love-based ones) due to an unexpected Uranian glitch or seemingly minor problem amplified to the extreme by the most unconventional of planets.

It actually makes a perfect sense — the breakup of the economical romance between the US and China is happening in the **area of technology and innovation that is ruled by Uranus**.

Now all astrological eyes are turned towards June lunar month that is clearly a **promising yet emotionally volatile time period** when things may go either way.
