Unfoldment of every Moon cycle is deeply influenced by **planetary alignments** that take place around the **moment of the New Moon**.

The **Moon cycle** timeline spans between **May 5 to June 3** and will culminate on **May 18 with the Full Moon** on the cusp between **Scorpio and Sagittarius**. A quick preview of that date tells us that the Full Moon will be **challenged by the Black Moon squared** with both the Sun and the Moon, possibly suggesting that some hidden things may suddenly challenge your actions and achievements. An **advise is to not be too pushy or headstrong** and accept that there are some things about us that we don’t acknowledge even to ourselves. Having a **peek inside your “hidden room” of the Black Moon** and maybe even accepting its contents will smoothen the Full Moon passage from Scorpio to Sagittarius — the signs with natures that are contrary to the Moon watery and reflective cool substance.

Returning to the **New Moon**…

The **beginning of the next Moon cycle** is marked by two events, one before the New Moon and another is shortly after the New Moon:

* **Mars–Jupiter opposition** is 1 day before the New Moon, on May 4
* **Mercury–Uranus conjunction** is 3 days after the New Moon, on May 8

Let’s look at each.

### Mars–Jupiter opposition

One of my personal favourites, Mars–Jupiter conjunction brings up the **spirit of conquerors and achievers** that are capable of directing big tasks and **making things happen** in the real world. 

**Jupiter being retrograde** is not that bad at all. Not all retrogrades mean lacking, quite the opposite, some actually bring about time windows of opportunity and ability to focus and stay away from distractions. Jupiter is a lucky planet but can potentially become **“too much of everything”**: too much fun, too much spending… you name it! Jupiter retrograde brings a healthy degree of sobriety.

**Jupiter is currently in dignity** in its own sign of **Sagittarius** which is another excellent sign for jupiterean people. 

**Mars will be transitioning** between **Gemini and Cancer** and that will no doubt soften up and liquify the fiery planet. **Mars and Cancer don’t like each other**, they are of opposite natures.  Gemini is good for Mars so use current favourable energy to build enough momentum that will push Mars through the sign of Cancer, the period between May 15 and July 1.

### Mercury–Uranus conjunction

An **excellent combination for intelligence** multiplied by **originality and unconventional thinking**. Ideas come quick and electrify the mind with excitement of possibilities. A good time to grab one of those high flying ideas (or even ideals) and actually **stick with them for longer**. Mercury–Uranus is good at capturing the moment but not necessarily good at following through. **Cultivating perseverance** (that’s Saturn) and the **sense of direction** (that’s Mars) is the key to success in this cycle.

### Personal strategy for the Moon cycle

Ride current **Mars–Jupiter** energies of **excellence and achievement** while adding **Mercury–Uranus originality** into the mix.  And don’t forget: **be honest with your deeper self** — the **Black Moon** is ready to remind us of our complexes.
