When observing the chart for January 12, 2020 — the exact date of Saturn–Pluto conjunction — a few things stand out immediately:

It’s actually a **Sun–Saturn–Pluto conjunction** and any astrological aspect that involves the Sun is immediately magnified to its fullest potential. Mercury is also in the mix but it isn’t a major player in this particular heavy-weight combination.

**Jupiter’s alignment with the Moon’s South Node** introduces further expansion and perhaps gives us clues to look back into human history in order to see and to learn from previous experiences.

One can’t see this unique astronomical conjunction directly because **it’s perfectly covered by the Sun’s disc**, all planets are within 1º from each other, which is another pointer at uniqueness of this aspect especially knowing that Pluto reaches this degree of proximity to the ecliptic plane only **once every 124 years**.

Several significant planetary **energies have been concentrated in one single focal point**, plus the chart is lacking any other prominent aspects. An even more striking picture emerges if we look at the Solar System “from above” view where all three planets are all aligned behind the Sun while the Moon is at nearly opposite point, gradually receding after its Full Moon phase.

Saturn–Pluto is a very slow aspect, it takes about a year to develop and another year to fully separate. Each year also witnesses a couple months’ period of both planets moving in a retrograde manner. This cosmic ebb and flow process results in gradual but tangible changes in the world since we’re talking about easily noticeable time spans of just a few years, not decades. **Solidity of Saturn is being tested by subterranean forces of Pluto**. On an individual level it may lead to **reevaluation of personal affinities and associations with others**, adjustments of how you do things in the world, especially in the **money related spheres like business, finance and investment** since they are of a long term nature and relate directly to archetypes of Saturn, Pluto — and ultimately the Sun which is the symbol for gold and therefore stands of an **incorruptible eternal value, the “worth” factor of your actions**.
