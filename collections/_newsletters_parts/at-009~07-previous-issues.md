The previous issue discussed the timeline of [Saturn – Pluto conjunction of years 2019–2020–2021 and its karmic meaning](/posts/astrology/event/2019/03/14/timeline-of-saturn-pluto-conjunction-of-2020-and-its-karmic-meaning.html).

The one before pondered upon the annual Sun – Neptune conjunction of 2019.

Earlier we took a medium deep dive into how the four Elements rule over the Zodiac signs.

Also, we have explored the concept of waxing and waning aspects in the context of planetary cycles.

In the past we analysed Mars – Pluto squares of 2019 and the politics of nuclear warfare.

We touched on a topic of an archetype of love triangle, or why Jupiter and Venus always in love.

We also talked about manifestations of the signs of the Zodiac in the human body.
