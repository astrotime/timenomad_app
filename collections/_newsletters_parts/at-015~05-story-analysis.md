title: "The 4th of July: Judgement of Saturn on the South Node"
---

The main drama of the second half of June and first half of July will unfold itself along the lunar nodal line and the planets that are **crossing this line**:

* Mars on June 17
* Saturn on July 4
* the Sun on July 9

The Northern Solstice is happening on June, 21 and is going to be a special moment with **Venus–Jupiter opposition forming a convincing T-square with Neptune** retrograde. There is certainly something in this formation, yet it’s not easy to pinpoint exact specifics… it goes really well with anything Neptune-related. Venus–Jupiter opposition is favourable for artistic and spiritual pursuits and Neptune square can certainly inject some galactic inspiration. On the other hand having both Neptune and Jupiter retrograde may not manifest things in a clearly understood way. Yes, one may intuitively feel that something has shifted yet it’s too subtle and remote for daily awareness to capture the movement’s essence. The solstice could provide a **favourable time window for meditative silence** and letting go expectations, allowing for a greater truth to emerge by itself.

On the fiery side, **Mars is felt strongly** a few times during this period. Its conjunctions with Mercury, the North Node and later **exact square with Uranus on July 11** — while staying conjunct with **Mercury, this time retrograde** — may bring about unwelcome events of extreme, forceful and aggressive nature. That’s if one doesn’t control one’s mind and communication skills.

### Lunar nodes bring eclipses

Every time a New Moon happens in the vicinity of one of the lunar nodes, a **solar eclipse takes place**. What kind of influence solar eclipse makes is never fully clear until we experience it. 

With so many planets on the lunar nodes, the upcoming total solar eclipse of July 2 does not look like an easy event. The chart appears to be **tense like a violin string**:

* grace of Venus is not connected to anything
* Mars square Uranus pierces Mercury with its aggressive electricity
* both luminaries are opposed to Saturn–Pluto along the nodes lines

What can possibly go wrong?

### And perhaps the most intriguing piece of cosmic news…

The 4th of July is a special day for the US and it will be noted in the celestial domains too — **Saturn will be exactly conjunct to the South Node on July, 4** at 6:06 PM New York time.

What will it signify and bring is a big question worth pondering upon. Saturn in its own sign of Capricorn points at the past devoted to building structure and perhaps **becoming overly engrossed in the material side of it**. Too much of everything has been erected and that may have become a debt and burden for forward movement. Saturn on the South Node may manifest as the **structure that outgrew its owner** gradually becoming a strangling rather than supporting force.

This rings true given the current **political and economical situation in the United States**. The scale of complexity in the society seems to have outgrown the ability to manage it in a holistic and integral manner. We are witnessing a fascinating period when **long-established principles of governing are under increasing pressure**. The country has developed itself too fast, it consumed too fast and is now approaching the point of internal conflict between major internal forces. Will the long-established principles of democracy hold? Will there be a period of economic undoing? What kind of global conflicts will emerge out of it?

While we don’t know the answers to these questions, we can clearly see that **_the times they are a-changin’_** and the situation is developing towards significant changes and long lasting adjustments. Something is going to emerge and it will project a strong influence at the global scale. At the personal level it feels right to be aware and prepared, at least mentally.

**_P.S._**

The second chart is showing a beautifully **symmetrical double sesquisquare aspect** between Mars and both Jupiter and Neptune. For a better understanding of this minor “super-square” aspect closely tied to karma please refer to our recent story [“Minor astrological aspects and the domain of magic”](
