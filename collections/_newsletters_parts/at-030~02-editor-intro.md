**The power of “invisibles”** is amplified through the lens of this Full Moon. By the “invisibles” I mean both less obvious points and relationships within the astrological chart. I will get to that soon. Of all planets, **the Moon is the swiftest celestial traveller** – it covers the distance of a single Zodiac sign in mere 2.5 days. This speed gives the Moon its **paradoxical duality** – its fleeting nature that nevertheless perfectly capable of inducing significant emotional if not manic upheavals equally affecting the nature at large and each of us individually (even our cat always feels unsettled if the Full Moon is extra strong).

This Full Moon is marked by a stronger **irrationality and a touch of madness**. What makes it so? Through the power of minor aspects the Moon is directly connected to almost all planets with the exception of Uranus. Our gentle satellite pulls most of strings at once!

Most notably, the Moon forms a 135º sesquisquare with the mostly “invisible” trio cluster comprised of the **Black Moon, Venus and Chiron**. Sesquisquares are challenging, they bring up past unresolved conflicts pertinent to celestial entities involved. And here we go, the Black Moon and Chiron is a fitting duo for **“hard to let go of” tendencies** multiplied by **wounds of the past**. Another sesquisquare that is formed between the Moon and the South Node is likely to reveal karmic flashbacks exactly when we don’t want to be reminded of them. 

The technical term for a double minor aspect is **“spike”**. The sesquisquare spike results in a square at its base, producing the **famous “Thor’s hammer”** which is the modern name for this punctual and acute outburst of astral energies. Head over to my article [“Aspect patterns — the building blocks of astrological charts”](https://timenomad.app/posts/astrology/philosophy/2019/07/01/aspect-patterns-building-blocks-of-charts.html){: target="_blank"} if you want to learn about aspects patterns and their influences. 

This Full Moon is a case in point! Just look at the recent **mass shooting in a Thailand mall**: as they say the offender “went mad” likely due to issues that have arisen from selling his property. I don’t think the guy truly went mad, he still acted as a trained pro hence the scale of the outcome simply unthinkable for an amateur. It’s more likely that his unresolved past caught up with him and bursted out at the moment of the Full Moon.

But we have Venus helping us, don’t we? Hmm… **probably not this time though**. Scroll down to the Venus–Mars in the context of the current chart.
