The current chart is **predominantly influencing the Moon Nodes axis** with the energies of the Sun and Eris forming a hard square to the Nodes, while Pluto and Saturn firmly holding onto the Dragon's Tail.

#### Firstly, a few key observations

About 7 hours before the New Moon, Pluto have perfectly aligned with the **South Node of the Moon**, aka the Tail of the Dragon.

In about 7 days time (on April, 12) the **Sun will make an exact square** to both North and South lunar nodes.

Next day on April, 13 the **Sun will also conjunct with Eris** that has also recently squared with the lunar nodes.

On April, 10 the lucky planet **Jupiter will turn retrograde**.
 
#### What could it all mean?

The nodal axis of the Moon carries the symbolism of the **past-future timeline**. The South Node or the Tail of the Dragon is where we move from, the North Node of the Head of the Dragon is what we move towards.

Pluto is the planet of karma and transformation sitting on the Dragon’s Tail may indicate the **time when the debts need to be repaid**, it’s an opportunity to clean up the past and thus open up the future prospects. It’s the time of astrological **spring clean**.

The **Sun – Moon square** stands for a **conflict of interests that requires an active resolution**. The Sun wants fire, the Moon wants some cooling comfort. Those two polarities tend to confuse our decision making processes making us want all at once… but we have to realise that it’s highly likely not possible. We have to choose and stick to one most important direction that will ensure our safer passage through the time of Pluto alignment with the lunar nodes.

**Eris** carries feminine aspects of the Pluto energies and is likely to provoke some **deeper hidden tensions in partnerships**. It’s when some things get out of sync and it’s hard to pinpoint exactly why. An honest and intelligent approach will be a wise direction during this time.

Having **Jupiter retrograde** is not that bad at all! The planet of expansion has an undeniable tendency to get out of control and the situation will become unsustainable. Too much spending, too many plans. Retrograde movement of Jupiter may help to bring needed sobriety and **healthy judgement so much needed before rushing into action**.
