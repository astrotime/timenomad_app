We are currently one week away from the **vernal Equinox** that will take place **next Wednesday, March, 20**. The word vernal comes from Latin “ver” meaning “spring” and is a traditional name for the more modern notion of the March (or Northward) equinox. Since most of the Western astrology originated in the Northern hemisphere, the word vernal is perhaps more suitable for astrologically inclined minds, and there is a good reason for that…

You fill find a **short Equinox overview** is a few paragraphs down. But for now let’s look at the nearest few days.

**The Sun is currently square to Jupiter** and that’s a good new, regardless of the square being a “hard” aspect. The square actually pushes the Sun force into Jupiterian expansion so whatever big undertakings are currently active in your life, they will certainly benefit from the **extra boost of solar energy**.

The featured story below will cover the **ongoing Saturn – Pluto conjunction** in an attempt to put the current economical and political (mis)happenings into a broader context of the Saturn – Pluto planetary cycle that is currently wrapping itself up. We may be tempted to react at certain daily news but it’s not quite so when observing them from a **helicopter perspective**. Have a read and enjoy the flight!

On the path to renewal,<br>
