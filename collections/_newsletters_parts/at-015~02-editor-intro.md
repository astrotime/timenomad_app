The **Moon is at its peak activity on June 17** the day that is marked by both **Full Moon** and the **Jupiterian Moon** since the Moon is perfectly conjunct to Jupiter just 13 hours before its exact opposition with the Sun.

**Jupiter** is currently in retrograde movement until August 11 and thus **somewhat withdrawn from its usual expansiveness and optimism** thus diminishing the risk of overconfidence and excessive gestures. The fullness of the Moon is clearly impacted by this constrained state of Jupiterian energies. 

There is a good side though to this Moon–Jupiter conjunction: **Venus is doing its work** being opposed to the otherwise blown-out state of the Moon **minimising potential spillage of emotions** and rushed decisions. Venus in Gemini acts as a harmonising principle inviting for a dialogue and helping to mediate the differences.

**A mediation approach** is so desperately needed at this time of Mercury–Mars conjunction that is happening in close vicinity to the lunar North Node. Argumentative fire directed towards the future isn’t what we want long-term.

There is a **warning sign in the skies** though — several major celestial events are scheduled to happen in the second half of this Moon cycle: 

* northern **solstice** on June 21
* **total solar eclipse** on July 2 (one the New Moon)
* repeated **activation of the lunar nodes** line, first by Mars and then by Saturn
* the **4th of July** is marked by **Saturn on the Dragon’s Tail**

As to what it could bring to us… scroll down to read an extended commentary on this period including the 4th of July overview.

**Looking at the world at large**, the things appear to be heating up on the political arena as we move through this year of Saturn–Pluto conjunction. There is a risk of a new war as the US government seems to be ramping up its negative attitude towards Iran, and there is an ongoing escalation of the trade war between the US and China. These two trends are more than likely to shape the world in ways we can’t yet foresee.

We are hoping that the rational mind will prevail in this time marked by polarity and confrontation. 

It also a good reminder to **see your personal life circumstances as being in a transitional period** and allow things to take their shape using higher spirited forces of Venus and Neptune that have the power to compensate this assertive yet blind world.

Observing harmony,<br>
