This **Full Moon** is certainly going to be remembered in the astrological history. It is arguably one of **the most fiery** — as opposed to the biggest or fullest — Moons we have had. In this issue will we discuss what turned it that way and why it is always good to be ready for certain things in advance.

The biggest topic is obviously the **fire of Notre-Dame Cathedral** that was a deeply moving accident that should have been prevented but unfortunately we mostly notice the eggs that got irreversibly broken, an indispensable trait of the human nature.

We are going to look at the **Notre-Dame event by using the fixed stars** since they can offer some very good hints when it comes to precise local events. The fixed stars have that amazing nature of being the sources of some very punctual astral energies, something that every astrology enthusiast sees as powerful keys to unlock the meaning behind the chart.

Notwithstanding the drama of Notre-Dame, it was a lucky coincidence that **Time Nomad has finally introduced the Fixed Stars add-on**. Creating this add-on proved to be quite an adventure that took much longer than initially anticipated. I am going to tell a few words about this add-on in a few paragraphs’ time.

Chasing the fixed stars,<br>
