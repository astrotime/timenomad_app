September Equinox that marks the **middle point of the Solar year** is closely followed by the New Moon of September 28 — both events transition the world and its affairs into the next phase of motion and development. This phase is likely to **culminate around January 13 with the great Sun–Mercury–Saturn–Pluto alignment**, a rare astrological event not to be missed!

**Venus is beginning to emerge** from the Sun’s fiery dominance and gradually regaining its status of an evening, or morning, star depending on which hemisphere you live in. Traditionally astrologers would say that Venus was “combust” or, in other words, its essence subdued by overwhelmingly powerful rays of the Sun. As Venus is starting to appear in the skies, it’s a great time to reaffirm our relationships with this symbol of love, beauty and creativity. 

A special day in relationship to Venus is **October 3 when Venus will be conjunct with the fixed star Spica** of constellation Virgo. I am going to talk about this auspicious moment further down the page.

**Mars is completing its opposition to Neptune** and “liberating” us from the conflict of the two radically opposing principles that could have brought a degree of confusion and procrastination, something that always comes along with the endless waters of Neptune especially knowing that it was deepened by its conjunction with the Black Moon. Now that this period of uncertainty is over, we all can gear into the action mode that will energise our navigation through the October lunation.

To sum it all up, the October Moon cycle is shaped by an **energetic newness of both the equinox and the New Moon**, and further supported by Venus finally emerging from its solar bathtub. A well aligned time window to push forward materialising your plans and ideas!
