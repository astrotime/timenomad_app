This is was a **very special week** for a few reasons. And before we look into those reasons, let me highlight a few keywords that describe the planetary energies of this week: **fire and intoxication**.

Actually there is one more that we can start with, it’s **the void**. The void usually comes at the end of a planetary cycle, in our case it’s **the New Moon on March, 6**. During the New Moon phase, the Moon is conjunct with the Sun and no light is reflected into our psyche resulting in a certain standstill. It is the phase of darkness and emptiness that marks the **completion of the previous Moon cycle** that began on February 4. A couple days before the New Moon is a special time to **wrap up** what you’ve been doing, **pause** and give yourself a chance to **ponder upon** your next lunar month. Set your **goals and objectives**, reflect on what are you going to achieve, get yourself ready to **take on a mini-project** that you will have to complete by the 5th of April, the date of the next New Moon. The silence and stillness of the void will help you to plant the seeds for the coming 4.5 weeks.

This **New Moon has happened in Pisces** (tropical) and Pisces is also happens to be the completing 12th sign of the Zodiac circle. Having a **New Moon in Pisces** makes this phase extra special and important. It would be wise to listen to the voice of cosmic wisdom deep inside.

But there is more… Just mere 8 hours and 55 minutes after the New Moon a very significant conjunction has taken place, a **Sun–Neptune conjunction**. And this is a really big one, perhaps the **second most important** astrological event after the vernal Equinox. 

One can’t speak about the meeting of the Sun and Neptune without going deeper into the topics of **Cosmic Fire and intoxication**. Read the featured article below to learn about the massive forces behind this event that bring both challenge and give immense hope.

Embracing the void,<br>
