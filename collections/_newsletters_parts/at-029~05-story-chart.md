This slow, as everything that relates to both Saturn and Pluto, conjunction **unravels trough the whole of year 2020** and completes on January 31, 2021. 

It’s a **complex astrological dance** during which both planets turn retrograde and direct — twice, once in 2019 and once in 2020. Because of this to-and-fro movement, a **second not exact but tight approach takes place on October 4, 2020** with an orb of 2.84º. 

In other words we can expect the **whole of 2020 to be rather interesting** in terms of world developments. What becomes more apparent is the **increasing role on nature in human affairs**. Recent shock from disastrous bushfires in Australia have now been eclipsed by the January arrival of coronavirus in China that leaves little doubts about its world-wide expansion. 

The nature is becoming increasingly less invisible and complacent with human actions. **Perhaps nature is the new “variable” that humanity has to learn to take into respectful equation.** So far we lived with the idea that we can bend the nature to our will… well it turns out to be the other way round. Time to take the beating and change our ways?

An overview of important Saturn-Pluto dates for 2020. Note that October 4 event when Pluto turns from retrograde to direct is **strengthened by Jupiter conjunction and multiple squares** with Mars, Eris, the Black Moon and the Sun. That’s pretty hot!
