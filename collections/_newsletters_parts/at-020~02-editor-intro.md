I think that the New Moon of August 30 is a **special and powerful event** that ushers us all into a new period of time both on personal level and in the domain of worldly affairs. To be more precise, the Moon by itself isn’t likely to usher us that much but its active combination with other planets bound to produce some tangible influences.

The best thing about this **New Moon** is that it’s **on the perigee** meaning the Moon is at the point of its closest distance to the Earth. Both astrologically and astronomically speaking the New Moon means its conjunction with the Sun. Looking at the Sun (don’t) makes one perceive the New Moon’s position in the sky.

What’s more, the Moon on perigee means it is **directly opposite the Black Moon** point. This adds some “black moon” qualities to already invisible Moon. Symbolically one may speak about the time of tension between the emotional domain and subconscious “shadow” within oneself. This potentially exposes us to certain ideas and desires that were brewing deep inside but haven’t emerged as conscious statements and impulses. 

Having all **“fast and personal”** planets — **Mercury, Venus and Mars** — **conjunct with the Sun** signifies a strong astral push highlighting our potential in achieving what we wanted deep inside. That’s obviously provided one knows what they really want in the first place! And that’s the great lesson of the Black Moon: striving towards understanding ourselves at the “shadow” level.

Having the New Moon in Virgo invites for a **prudent and responsible attitude**, something that diligent Virgos know all too well. In the _Astrological Weather_ section down below I will talk more about a unique combination of forces in the current chart. 

Planning ahead,<br>
