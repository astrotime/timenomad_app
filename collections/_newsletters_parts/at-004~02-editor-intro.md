The month of February continues to move through the “red” zone of some fiery aspects.

Last night didn’t give a good chance of sleep as the **Moon moved past Uranus** and projected its electrifying intensity into otherwise restful night.

We are currently on track to a very interesting event of **Mars – Uranus conjunction** which will take place on **February 13 at 6:20 AM UTC**. The influence of Uranus is hard to predict, **it’s always sudden**. One thing we know for sure is that Uranus deals with all things electric. Uranus has to do with technology and things of the future.

**Tesla**, the electric car company, and **Elon Musk** in particular seem to be influenced by Uranian events. Last year we witnessed his sudden and failed attempt to take Tesla private and the mayhem that followed… pretty much on the day **Uranus went retrograde**, August 13, 2018.

Let’s sit back and see what will Uranus bring this month!

Stay cool,<br>
