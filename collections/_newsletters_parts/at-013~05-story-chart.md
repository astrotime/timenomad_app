The current chart presents at least two chapters that are worthy of discussion:

* **Venus–Uranus** conjunction
* **Full Moon coinciding with Sun–Mercury** in sextile and trine aspect to Saturn–Pluto

Let’s look at each.

### The Moon and Mercury: separating emotions from reason

The **rectangular formation** highlighted in yellow on the chart brings a **conflict between emotions** that belong to the Moon domain **and reasoning** that is a function of Mercury. 

This Moon cycle is marked by reasonable communication negatively influenced by **old unresolved debts of misunderstanding**, or even **karma** that comes from Saturn, Pluto and the South Node — all three bodies have direct connection to karmic forces.

During the second half of this lunar month the lines of communication may break down replaced by seemingly puzzling **emotional and self-centric behaviour**. In such times, the ability to stay open and not being carried away by “here I am certainly right” attitude will repay itself — provided understanding that **time and patience**, both being Saturn qualities, often change things in a more reliable manner than any short lived conflict.

Realising **inherent weakness of any emotional state**, it is wise to let reasoning steer the ship through turbulent seas.

### Venus and Uranus: eccentric love

This one is fun! **Uranus demands originality** and when it comes to Venus and its values towards love and relationships in general, the two planets take human engagement to the next level full of surprises — equally **entertaining and electrifying**.

As much as **Venus loves romance and beauty**, Uranus likes to add an unconventional twist to pretty much everything it touches. Both **humorous and erratic, Uranus** is unpredictable by its very nature.

Venus–Uranus conjunction may equally signify a beginning of a **new and unusual relationship** as well as a **sudden break up of existing partnerships** (and not only love-based ones) due to an unexpected Uranian glitch or seemingly minor problem amplified to the extreme by the most unconventional of planets. 

Every person who has strong **Uranus energy is revolutionary and independent** at their core. And if you are on the “receiving end” then a better strategy is to **embrace your partner’s eccentricity** and erratic traits rather than try to correct them. Uranus gets electrified very quickly by to any seemingly minor friction. Well, it always thrives on unexpected and the best attitude is to **introduce humour**. Uranus people love witty and sharp humour, that’s where **Venusian creative flair** can make real miracles when it comes to either romantic relationship or a business partnership.

Out of all planets, it’s perhaps **Venus that can handle Uranus the best**. It knows how to blend seduction and creativity, how to use the force of inspiration that Uranus adores. Venus knows how to be unusual and out of this world. Beauty is the force that is able to reach everyone, and **Uranus loves that feeling**.
