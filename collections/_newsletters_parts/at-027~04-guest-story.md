In the distant past of our civilization, **the magical properties of gemstones and metals were a part of everyday life**. Back then people were much more attuned to the powers of crystals, the forces of nature and the universe at large.

**Humans were receptive to these forces,** they lived in sync with the “source” — the nature, god, the universal consciousness — whatever you prefer to call it.

Then followed centuries of religious dogma and restrictions, when people were supposed to believe what they are told and never ask questions. **Curiosity was the sin and ancient knowledge vanished.**

Finally, the modern era of **science, technology and all-penetrating materialism** resulted in deadening of our subtle perceptions. 

But times are changing... Many of us feel the calling, the power behind gemstones, the “stories” that are ready to be told. But we are still **not quite familiar with the “language”** with which these forces communicate with us.
