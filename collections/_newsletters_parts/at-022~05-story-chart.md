Much of October is influenced by Venus–Uranus opposition supported by a good injection of Mercury’s inherent talent for handling dualities of all kinds.

**Mercury is a master of many trades** as it knows how to cross the boundaries and thus an excellent helper in both ideation and mediation processes. Our earlier story [“Myths and truths behind Mercury retrogrades”](https://timenomad.app/posts/astrology/philosophy/2019/07/15/myths-and-truths-behind-mercury-retrograde.html){: target="_blank"} digs into  exceedingly flexible nature of Mercury that makes it such a source of special astrological know how.

When it comes to the fountain of creativity and the ability to generate new and elegant solutions, **Venus and Uranus fit each other perfectly well**. Venus is perhaps one of few planets that Uranus can relate to — it’s worth remembering that according to traditional mythology **Venus was born out of Uranian creative faculties**.

### Venus and Spica, the fixed star

A few days before Venus becomes opposed to Uranus, its powers will be fortified and enhanced by a truly magnificent alignment with Spica, the main star in the constellation of Virgo.

The exact date of **Venus–Spica conjunction is October 3**. For those who are in New York, the exact time is 7:13 PM, the celestial couple will be briefly visible right after the sunset.

Spica is the **major marker of the starry domain**. It is the famous “middle point” that is directly opposite the zero Aries point of the sidereal Zodiac. Thus one may say that Spica to the sidereal Zodiac system is what the March Equinox point to the tropical Zodiac system.

**A star’s proximity to the ecliptic is the direct indicator of its astral strength.** And Spica doesn’t fail to deliver as it’s only 2º south of the ecliptic. The only other major Behenian star that is closer to the ecliptic is Regulus (alpha Leo, 0º3’ north of the ecliptic) but Spica is almost twice brighter plus it is empowered by the strength of its geometrical position. 

The stars are fascinating astral powerhouses! If you’re interested to enhance your astrological repertoire and skills, feel free to read our story called [“Understanding the role of Fixed Stars in astrology”](https://timenomad.app/posts/astrology/philosophy/2019/05/03/fixed-stars-in-astrology.html){: target="_blank"}.

Spica holds extremely potent astral forces. It shines success supported by **discernment and exactitude**. The honourable star of excellence works well with Venus. Spica is said to be of a combined nature of Venus and Mars, or sometimes of Venus, Jupiter and Mercury. Either way Venus is a part of the equation!

Spica is one of the fifteen Behenian (“root”) stars, **its stone is Emerald and the herb is Sage**.
