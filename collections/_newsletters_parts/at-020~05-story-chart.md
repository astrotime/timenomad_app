Current New Moon chart comes with a potent combination of aspects and patterns, it’s well structured and expressive. The main chapters are:

* a cluster formed by the **New Moon, the Sun, Mercury, Mars and Venus**
* the **Moon and Black Moon–Neptune opposition** upheld by a Jupiter square
* a **grand trine** formed by the New Moon cluster, Saturn and Uranus

Firstly, as the **Black Moon holds the key to this chart** I’d like to offer a refresher article on the Black Moon titled [“In the “shadow” of the Black Moon”](https://timenomad.app/posts/astrology/philosophy/2019/07/31/the-shadow-of-the-black-moon.html). The Black Moon isn’t necessary easy to grasp but it’s worth knowing some key facts about its existence and influence.

The **New Moon cluster** that happens in Virgo is opposed by dignified Neptune in its own sign of Pisces. There is a polarity between down-to-earth attitude of Virgo and  idealistic nature of Neptune that is influencing our decisions through the Black Moon subconscious connection. This introduces a possibility of self-delusion and the need to assess one’s ideas through Virgo’s practicality and diligence. Especially knowing that now direct Jupiter is also dignified in its own sign of Sagittarius and thus pushing towards expansion and over reaching. Prudence is the key to the new lunar month!

**Current chart is noted for its aspect patterns**, and if you’re interested to learn more then head over to our story called [“Aspect patterns — the building blocks of astrological charts”](https://timenomad.app/posts/astrology/philosophy/2019/07/01/aspect-patterns-building-blocks-of-charts.html).

**The grand trine is certainly a blessing in this chart.** It is composed out of multiple trines between the Sun–Moon–Mercury–Mars–Venus (wow!) cluster, Saturn and Uranus. Trines introduce dynamism and in this case one can speak of Saturn–Uranus influence that is known to be of mostly harmonious nature as the two planets’ energies combine both lofty novelties and precise rigour of planning, that’s when they are in favourable composition. Having retrograde Uranus in fall in Taurus while Saturn is in dignity in Capricorn hints at Saturnian dominance that is reinforced by its conjunction with the South Node and Pluto, both entities grounded in reality and past deeds. Perhaps this may hint at the need to establish new foundations **tapping from the results of past efforts** and what’s been built over last years if not decades.
