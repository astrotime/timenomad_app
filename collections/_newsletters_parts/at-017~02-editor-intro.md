How difficult can this Full Moon of July 16 be? The peak of the lunation happens in conjunction with the **heavyweights of Pluto and Saturn** adding some low-pitch undertones to the Moon that is also in the near vicinity of its South Node thus manifesting a **lunar eclipse, a partial one this time** since the Moon isn’t too close to the Dragon’s Tail.

Every **Moon–Pluto conjunction** is a rather challenging time due to the depths of Pluto bubbling up towards the surface of human emotional landscape. Not the time to be taken easily — but not the time to dwell on despair either! It’s the time of learning how to handle Pluto’s underground intensity without being irrationally swayed by the emotional maelstrom. Because there’s a prize ahead.

**Handling the Moon–Pluto fullness** takes a good degree of honesty and emotional maturity, being able to say _“I can live through challenging dilemmas”_ to oneself. Only then the real potential of this conjunction can reveal itself through rich creative flows coming up from ultimate depths.

The fact that the **Full Moon coincides with a lunar eclipse** adds an extra degree of challenge that can be transformed into an opportunity especially in the area of self-development. Supported by plutonic directness, the inner truths — however controversial they may be — are now accessible and should be accounted for. They hold the keys to fundamental aspects of personal emotional makeup. Seizing this opportunity may not be for the faint-hearted but there is a promise for the determined ones. The rewards are worth it: the path ahead will be cleared up and the **motivation renewed and recharged**.

The current astrological chart conveys a **sense of expectation**, it’s focused and condensed, not unlike a satellite dish receptively attuned to the universal broadcast. The _Astrological weather_ further down the page looks into what makes this moment in time important and unique.

We all most certainly experiencing the **usual dose of Mercurial glitches** during this retrograde period and I thought it’s a good time to look into why it happens — enjoy the _Featured story_ about Mercury retrogrades below.
