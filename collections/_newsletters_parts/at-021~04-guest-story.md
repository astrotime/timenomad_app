**If I’d say that magic is everywhere** that probably may sound like a cliche. Yet I do believe it’s true. You don’t need to perform complicated rituals, know secrets spells and have supernatural abilities to get in touch with magic. You just need to be curious and receptive and all the rest will follow.

Curiosity helps to learn new concepts while receptivity allows to open up your mind, heart and entire energy to something bigger than you. All together **it transforms you and the way you see and interact with the world**. And that is already magical. Because magic is the process of transformation.

The world is made of **subtle and seemingly invisible vibrations** that are constantly being transformed into what we call matter — something we can see, touch and experience with our regular senses. Matter has texture and density, it forms different shapes and comes in a  variety of colours… yet here on Earth it is directly connected to the planetary forces and sacred geometry — leading us all the way up to the divine consciousness itself (of whatever you prefer to call it). 

**Gemstones, metals and sacred geometry is my favourite domain of magic**. That’s what I am interested to explore in depth… I love to manifest this magic in the form of jewellery because it allows to unpack pure underlying principles and connects us with the forces that expand our perception and transform the quality of life, here and now.

**Sacred Geometry** helps to connect with the archetypal principles and bring clarity into our lives. [Read more about Sacred Geometry…](https://gemsinstyle.com/blogs/news/tagged/sacred-geometry){: target="_blank"}

**Gemstones** are an incredible source of power that can facilitate desirable changes, protect, support and inspire. [Read more about gemstone properties…](https://gemsinstyle.com/blogs/news/tagged/gemstone-properties){: target="_blank"}

**Colour** is the interface between subtle invisible energies and the domain of physicality and matter. Multitude of colours bring about that sense of pure magic that we are blessed to be surrounded here, on Earth.

**The art, craft and mystery of jewellery** connects and binds all these subtle principles — so you can have them all at once. And this is magical!
