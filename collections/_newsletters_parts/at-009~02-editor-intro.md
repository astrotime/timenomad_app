Only a few days passed since the **vernal Equinox** and it certainly feels like the new astrological year is already gearing in. And that is **happening way too fast**! There are some reasons why this year could be **a bit more turbulent**, at least emotionally.  And this Equinox is certainly not like any other, and here is why…

Symbolically, the **Equinox is the time of equilibrium** that delineates the boundary between the previous zodiacal year and the beginning of the next unfoldment. The time of the Equinox is somewhat of a **cosmic reset** when old things have been wrapped up and the new impulse is just about to start unravelling. So it’s a kind of the **New Moon moment** when things are supposed to get quieter thus allowing for the new beginnings to sprout in a peaceful silence.

On a contrary, this Equinox that took place on March, 20 was closely **followed by a Full Moon** that peaked a mere 3h45m after the Equinox. The Full Moon was really intense and blasting, quite a few people have commented on that. Scroll down for our regular _Astrological Commentary_ for more details.
