The New Moon phase of July 2 comes with a **total solar eclipse followed by Saturn on the South Node** on July 4. As I have written in the previous issue, eclipses happen when the Moon is on one of its nodes — they are **special astrological moments that link past and future**. And we currently seem to be on one of those junction points indeed. The first two weeks of July have that unmistakable flavour of decisive power presenting each of us an opportunity to **gear into the second quarter** of the Solar year.

The second quarter of the Solar year begins with the Solstice on June 21 and culminates at the moment of September Equinox on September 23. This is the period for **unfoldment and manifestation of our annual impulses** and aspirations. The period that leads to the “harvesting” phase later this year.

Close alignment of the New Moon, Solstice and the eclipse brings the **flavour of challenge and opportunity**. Some of our hidden inner compartments may come to the surface and will require certain **scrutiny and, ultimately, acceptance**. That’s the power of the South Node, or the Dragon’s Tail that sits tightly conjunct with Saturn, the agent of time and judgement.

A wiser attitude is to accept the luggage of the past and limitations it imposes. This makes even more sense in the light of **unfolding “season” of Uranian squares**. Each of us is likely to have a history of accumulated emotional debts that sit mostly dormant until the force of “sudden“ knocks the door off its hinges. The period of July–August brings about **solid five weeks of Uranus squares** — Mars and Mercury, then the Sun and Venus and finally Mercury again. 

**Did we forget Mercury retrograde?**

Retrograde Mercury–Mars conjunction brings much needed **inquisitive attitude towards ourselves**, helping our minds to see deeper instead of endlessly seeking out, at times in a desperate and inflamed manner. This can become a productive take on Uranus–Mars square unfoldment during the first three weeks of July.

_Astrological Commentary_ and _Astrological Weather_ further down the page provide additional details about this Mercury retrograde period in the crosshair of Uranian influence.

This lunation equally pulls the strings at the **world’s spectacle of money, power and politics**. There is a combined feeling of lingering hope mixed with brittle caution. The time of fragility due to multitude of loose ends. Can they handle that? We are keeping our fingers crossed that cooler heads will prevail.
