**Why have people always been captivated by the moonlight?**

Moonlight is not just **mystical and romantic**, it is also a carrier of incredible cleansing powers for all things living and beyond… **crystals too “love” being bathed** in the revitalising energy of the moonlight.

Full Moon is the time when cleansing and recharging principles of the moonlight are being **amplified to their highest potential**.

Every Full Moon offers you a perfect opportunity to **purify vibrations and recharge the “batteries”** of your minerals whatever they could be — your gemstone jewellery or a crystal specimen collection.

**What is so special about the moonlight and particularly Full Moon light?**

The Moon doesn’t produce any light itself, instead it acts as a cosmic mirror that reflects the light of the Sun. While sunlight can be warming and welcoming it can also be **taxing, burning and damaging** (we know it all too well here in Australia). 

On the contrary, **gemstones have been formed deep underground** and have never been exposed to the blasting energy of direct sunlight, they are not naturally accustomed to its irradiating intensity.

That’s where we are lucky to have the Moon — it receives, modifies and distributes the light received from the Sun thus **transforming it into a cooling, cleansing and soothing principle**. The Sun is the giver of life, the Father principle, and the Moon is a pure Mother principle — feminine and nurturing life force.

**Time periods during Full Moon**, including nights before and after, are natural opportunities to **cleanse and recharge your crystals** and gemstone jewellery. Put your gems outside or simply leave them on your window sill and let the Full Moon do its job. **Don’t forget to bring them back early in the morning** because gemstones don’t appreciate being exposed to the direct sunlight, some can even loose the colour or develop cracks.

Give your gemstones a good moonlight bath. **Your crystals will love it as much as you do.**
