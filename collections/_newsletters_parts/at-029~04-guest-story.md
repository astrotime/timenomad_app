Have you ever wondered how planetary energies and the archetypes they represent “unpack” themselves in gemstones and metals? And, by the way, **what are the archetypes?**

To put it simply, for many things and beings that exist down here on Earth there are corresponding blueprints that exist in celestial realms. As we know, **blueprints are always perfect** and rather an ideal representation of the creator’s vision. Yet no matter how perfect the design was, the real world implementation will **invariably drift from the original plan**. That’s life!

The astrological principles are somewhat similar to the archetypes and **gemstones are great “connectors” to astral spaces and forces**. Despite being thoroughly manifested in the physical world, gemstones still retain an amazing degree of archetypal purity — adorable marvels that lend themselves to a variety of **practical and magical applications**.

**Larimar** — the Atlantis Stone — represents a beautiful synergy of Uranus and Neptune planetary energies — the power of futuristic vision and highly idealistic values.
