The New Moon initiates current lunation with a **beautifully prominent Venus–Neptune conjunction** that happens to be in tropical Pisces, the sign traditionally ruled by Neptune and in which Venus is exalted, a double win! **If you’re a stargazer** then you can obviously notice that diamond-like shining Venus is actually in the **constellation of Aquarius** and therefore in the same sidereal sign of Aquarius. 

Yes, that’s the ongoing debate about **which Zodiac model is more “precise”**. I believe that some very simple observations point at actual validity of both systems, both systems can be used in parallel and that only enriches astrological vision: while there are infinitely many ways to divide a circle into 12 parts, **both sidereal and tropical divisions rest on astronomical reality and esoteric principles**. If you’re a curious kind and would like to refresh your understanding, head over to [“The Sidereal Zodiac in astrology, its strengths and weaknesses”](/posts/astrology/philosophy/2019/03/23/sidereal-zodiac-in-astrology-its-strengths-and-weaknesses.html){: target="_blank"}

Already strong energy of Venus–Neptune conjunction is additionally **stimulated and challenged by Mars square** to both planets. The **Venus–Neptune combo always speaks of “love”**, both earthy love and celestial love that are surprisingly two different modalities of the phenomena of love. While Venus always needs harmonious and ideally beautiful relationships, Neptune takes the notion of “ideal”  beyond the earthy domain all the way to trans-galactic spheres and universal expansion. No wonder **Neptune aspects are tricky to handle well without getting intoxicated by own’s dreams, illusions and… delusions**. Inspired if not blinded by strong Venus–Neptune one may seek for the ultimate love in all the wrong places. This aspect is **better enjoyed through internal feelings** as both Venus and Neptune are too “celestial” to be reliably embodied and hugged down here on Earth. **Go for all things art** — as art inspires and brings the sense of awe and harmony while preserving its lofty and intangible nature. Indulgence is the curse, **appreciation and enjoyment is the key!**

Influence of **Mars that has recently passed the fixed star Antares** introduces an additional dimension to Venus–Neptune: it makes it spicy and “scorpionic”. Something to be aware of is Mars’ natural propensity to **push a bit too hard, to grasp**. That certainly works well in business and performance sports. Yet watch out when it comes to everything Venus–Neptune: if subtle enjoyable balance suddenly turns into frustration and anger then **you know that’s Mars taking over**. A good strategy is to pull back from the red zone and stay on the soft side of emotional spectrum, keep the sense of wellbeing, warmth and enjoyment. Mars square challenge concludes on February, 9.

Finally, there’s always something to talk about the **ever-unfolding Saturn–Pluto conjunction**… read _Astrological Weather_ down the page.
