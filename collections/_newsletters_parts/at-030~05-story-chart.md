title: When Venus and Mars are ready for war

We often think of Venus and Mars as **ever attracted perfect carriers of passion**. Indeed, love and romance are more often than not orchestrated by this pair of libido-inducing energies. 

Yet it would be a mistake to envisage Venus as a **cute blonde wrapped in pink**. It certainly knows how to express itself that way, especially when helped by the Moon or Neptune. 

The true Venus archetype matches its planetary nature. Planet Venus is an **extremely hot, highly pressurised ball that spins in the opposite direction** of all other planets covered by a super dense atmosphere rich in sulphur, thunder and lightning. In other words, Venus can also express itself as another side of violence. **Mars is hot and ruthless**, **Venus is boiling and never forgives**. When joined together by a “hard” aspect they can form a perfectly malefic combination.

The current chart has that negative side of Venus–Mars square where Venusian negative tendencies are being **reinforced by the hidden nature of the Black Moon** multiplied by **old wounds of Chiron**. Simply add **Mars–Uranus trine** into the mix!
