It’s hard to write about this **Full Moon mostly due to its fast nature** that is being radiated by the exceeding lunar fullness invigorated by its opposition to the **spectacular passage of Mercury across the Sun’s disk**, an event that lasted just under 6 hours and charged the Moon with its speed and dynamic energy. 

**Mercury that remains retrograde until November 21** makes an attempt at aligning with Mars–Uranus opposition but it won’t succeed due to its course reversing back from **retrograde to direct**. Yet the period between **November 21 and 24 resolves itself through an amplified tension between Mars and Uranus**, both planets of fiery domain, the former is of direct and cutting nature while the latter is the source of unexpected outbursts that herald reforms and innovation into collective human consciousness. 

Following Mercury’s lead, **the Moon also joins Mars–Uranus opposition** on the Mars side of balance thus potentially signalling an **impatient attitude** and desire for excitement which needs to be understood as a reflection of a deeper need for changes and progressing along the desired path of career and personal development. **Mercury and the Moon are the swiftest of all celestial bodies** and this fact goes together well with directness of Mars and novelty of Uranus. So start preparing for that special time window of November 24 beginning from the Full Moon.

November 24 is the day that packs **not one, but two exact aspects!** The first is a Mars–Uranus opposition, the second one is a **magnificent Venus–Jupiter conjunction**. Both aspects becoming exact within hours of each other, a truly astonishing cosmic synchronicity that equally brings forward challenge and a blessing that may help those who seek and dare. I am going to discuss some of many wonders of Jupiter meeting Venus down the page.

Excited,<br>
