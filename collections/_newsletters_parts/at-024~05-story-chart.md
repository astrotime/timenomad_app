We are currently blessed with this beautiful conjunction clearly visible in the evening skies — **Mercury and Venus are exactly conjunct on October 30** just one day before Mercury makes a U-turn and begins its **retrograde phase on October 31**. This highlights the fact that Mercury is at its maximum angular separation from the Sun thus making itself much more **energetically available to human endeavours**.

Regardless of retrograde movement, **Mercury and Venus combine their energies well**. Both bodies are the closest of all to the Sun and therefore connect us to the spirit of solar creativity and energy of life. If one believes in angels or accepts the idea of higher beings in general then those two planets are the best conduits to relate to all principles above this mortal plane.

In any case, enjoy the **heightened sense of aesthetics and harmony** that this celestial couple passes so well — **and keep your spirit young.**
