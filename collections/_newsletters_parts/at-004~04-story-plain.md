There is certainly a **growing feeling of suspense as this February** moves through hard aspects like Mars – Pluto square, Mars – Uranus conjunct and Mars – Eris conjunct. What can this configuration bring?

#### Highlight #1

After the moment of exact **Mars – Uranus conjunction on 13 February**, Mars will finally escape the vice formed by Eris and Uranus. This should bring some relief.

#### Highlight #2

We have written about the upcoming [Saturn – Pluto conjunction at length](/posts/astrology/event/2018/12/22/saturn-pluto-conjunction-year-2019.html). A fresh addition is the **South Node** of the Moon that is due to become **exactly conjunct with Pluto** in about seven weeks, on April 4 (UTC). That’s the one to watch. Both South Node and Pluto deal with karma, **some karmic debt** may be on the plate this time.

**Venus – Saturn conjunction** that will happen on 18 Feb 10:51 AM UTC will be a very beautiful event. Venus goes well with pretty much everything, even with old and grumpy Saturn!
 
#### Highlight #3 — Procyon, the star

That’s an interesting one. The **North Node** of the Moon is currently conjunct with the fixed star **Procyon** and will become exact on **Feb 23, 9:47 AM UTC**.

**Fixed star Procyon** is located close to the constellation of Cancer (it is actually alpha Canis Minor) and is not considered a lucky star by any account. I have personally heard a lot of stories about how **Procyon messed up planned events**. Watch out for this naughty derailer!
