In the previous issue we rightfully suspected that **Mars Pluto square** of the 2nd February 2019 may bring some serious fire in excess. Well, what can be more fiery than a nuclear missile!

Luckily they are not flying yet but the fuse has been set and ready — the US administration has announced its unilateral withdrawal from the 32 year long treaty of non-proliferation of short- and medium-range nuclear missiles. 
We don’t normally cover political happenings but this one is an important exception since the **world peace is what we all really want**.

The featured story below will offer some astrological analysis of this very important event that will certainly find its place in future history books.

Stay cool, always,<br>
