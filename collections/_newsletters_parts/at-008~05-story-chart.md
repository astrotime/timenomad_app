The vernal Equinox is the **“zero”** counting point of the Zodiac, it’s the moment when the Sun crosses the cusp between the tropical signs of Pisces and Aries. 

And that’s why the word “vernal” passes so much more meaning, it’s the **astrological spring time**, regardless of what hemisphere you’re located.

From the astrological standpoint, the vernal Equinox is the real new year, it makes much more sense compared to the traditional January, 1. 

The vernal Equinox is a good time for any kind of **“spring” ritual** in whatever form you prefer to:

* announce your **affirmations** for the next Zodiacal cycle 
* celebrate the **new beginnings** and freshness of the impulse
* tune your energy **towards the future** with joy and hope

The second interesting moment is the fact that the **Full Moon** is just 3h45min after the Equinox, that should bring an **extra fullness to your celebration**.

And lastly, as you can see on the chart it’s the **Sun – Chiron conjunction** that will become exact on Friday, March, 22. According to the mythology, Chiron is the wounded healer and symbolises **the part of us that needs to be healed**. A very auspicious time to allow this to happen.
