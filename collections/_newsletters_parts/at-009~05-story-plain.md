title: New astrological year and the Full Moon explosion
---

Having the Full Moon at the time of the Equinox certainly **introduced a dissonant note**, a potential “conflict of interests”. It’s akin to a **New Moon and a Full Moon happening all at once**. 

Such a confusing astrological event is very likely to set a tone for **the whole of the current zodiacal year** until the next Equinox of March 19, 2020. 

Here is what I think the **next 12 months** could bring:

The year has started emotionally charged and literally **“too full”** to accomodate for the new growth.

**On the personal front** this can lead to some rushed choices based on overwhelming emotions rather than careful observation and planning before acting. Be aware of this and remember to ask yourself “what if I am just reacting and exploding right now won’t be in my best interest long-term?” Then it could be wise to go for a hike in a forest and enjoy the nature instead!

**On the world stage** we may see some potential diplomatic hiccups and unexpected discord as the parties will be unable to withdraw from their emotional stance.

**The financial markets** are often driven by emotions as they are based on an unlikely combination of cold rational thinking and emotional herd-like behaviour. Will be fun to watch the rollercoaster unwind!
