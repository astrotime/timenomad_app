Every Full Moon presents us with a challenge — the sense of **peaking monthly activity** and general blossoming of life is counterbalanced by the **opposition of contradictory forces**. After all, Full Moon is an astrological opposition between the Sun and the Moon and therefore potentially highlights certain existential questions that require resolution via a compromise. We can’t have it all, or can we?

It’s about a month left until the great Saturn–Pluto conjunction of January 13, 2020 and I think this time is best spent **looking into the past** in order to better understand the future.

There is a number of theories as to what Saturn–Pluto alignment will bring to the world. Recently my personal focus has been an analysis of the human factor at the world scale and what kind of **generational shift we are moving into**. Here I’d like to present my astrological ideas about the so-called **“Silver Tsunami”** — the next two-three decades during which the generation of **Baby Boomers will be disengaging** from being professionally active as well as ceasing their incarnation on Earth — both trends growing in ever increasing numbers. In January 2020 the oldest boomers are 74 years old while the youngest reach 56 years of age.

This dynamic affects the world scene in ways that we can’t yet full comprehend. One can certainly envisage **changes in housing, financial and political spheres**. After all the Baby Boomers generation of 1946–1964 was and still is an economically influential slice of population. That generation is equally celebrated for its productivity and criticised for its excesses.

From an astrological perspective, the generational core values will begin to diminish and dissipate their influence on the psyche of the world in the next 20 years. Most notably, **Baby Boomers are described as a generation open to experiment, valuing individualism and free spirit**. After all **rock and roll music was their invention!** And truly one may notice how contemporary musical scene is tilting towards marketable complacency and conveniency of conformism. One of many signs telling us how the world is gradually being morphed by the upcoming generational waves and economical reality.

Back to the Full Moon… the blossoming of life as well as fruits and challenges it brings are so much akin to this **generational tidal shift** that is gradually developing before our eyes. The bigger picture of the Saturn–Pluto conjunction as the harbinger of the changing world.

Wonders of time,<br>
