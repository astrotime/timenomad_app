Welcome to the **Uranian New Moon**, a great and brief celestial alignment that coincided the New Moon with the **Sun–Uranus exact conjunction**. We are currently at the beginning of the new November lunar cycle that has begun with the sense of “perfectly unexpected” configuration. Uranus is still retrograde and perhaps not as edgy but regardless of that the world is prepping itself for more news to come as the **Sun is traversing through the domain of Scorpio**.

**Uranus** not only brings flashes and intuition, it also **awakens and shakes things up**. Uranus is traditionally associated with the future and the ability to see and predict things before they manifest themselves on the worldly scene. Ultimately, in the human body **it’s the Moon that “sees” by receiving Uranian spontaneity** via bodily senses and subtle feelings. The challenge comes from the electric nature of Uranus that can potentially result in feeling agitated and restless. 

If **Uranus is the fire in the sky, Mars is the fire of the physical domain** that sparks drive, competitiveness and often aggression. In November Mars is travelling from one square to another, from Saturn to Pluto, and on **November, 5 an exact square takes place between Mars and Pluto**. Both are the planets of fire and squares between them tend to bring out combustive confrontations resulting in groundbreaking outcomes since Pluto is the planet of all things related to the Underworld.

Is it a time to **dive into action or to stay calm and observe?** The answer will depend on how well one can handle agitation potentially coming out of the Sun–Uranus opposition. If you feel like your hand and spirit are steady then proceed while carefully navigating around any long-term unresolved issues for Pluto always keeps the score. In the case of feeling restless, a useful advice would be to find a **peaceful harbour exploring your creativity**, and that’s where **Mercury–Venus conjunction** lends us its helping joyful wings.

Wings in the sky,<br>
