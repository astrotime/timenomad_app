June 16 **eclipsed Full Moon** is nearly perfectly aligned with the middle of the calendar year and thus the **middle of the northern hemisphere summer**. During this short and focused astrological period we are traversing the **peak of annual development**. Intentions have been firmly planted and the second half of the year will reap the outcomes of both wise and foolish decisions.

The chart is **beautifully sharp and present**. Truly one of its kind. Curious astrologer can write heaps about its chapters, forces and predict potential outcomes. 

A few highlights that captured my attention… 

### Long-term Jupiter–Neptune square

Quite possibly we are witnessing this aspect playing out at the political arena. Both planets are of **excessively expansive nature**, one airy and another watery. In some situations the square helps by bringing the necessity to come up with big ideas and equally big initiatives. In other situations the square may result in blown-out policies and inflated regulatory practices, something that seems to have been brewing for a while in the financial sector.

### Squares to Uranus

July witnesses several major planets making a square with Uranus: Mars, the Sun, Mercury and finally Venus. The “usual suspects” are Mars and the Sun. Those two planets **perfectly complement the unexpected factor of Uranian nature** by supplying it with combustive fuel in plenty. Some electrifying events or changes can be expected to happen as the result of fire challenging if not outwardly provoking the eclectic and revolutionary nature of Uranus.

### Sesquisquare spikes

A sesquisquare spike is also known as a “Thor’s hammer” in popular astrology signifies intense karmic forces in this case pointing at the Sun. This may question and **challenge current practices of power and attitude toward others**. This is the time period when blinding certainty should be replaced by the quest for validity and sustainability.

Late July will see the same spike pointing at Venus, hopefully a softening influence wrapping up this intense lunar month.
