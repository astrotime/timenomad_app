This **New Moon is extra black** and black doesn’t meet bad or scary, it means a **greater more profound depth**. Midnight starry sky is virtually empty, not a single planet appears to be visible. There are certainly stars in plenty! All planets are still positioned on the Sun side of the Solar System and thus disappear at night. 

**Black is beautiful.** It makes you see things better. That’s perhaps why astrology has its roots in the **darkness of the night sky**. Embracing emptiness is often the key to understanding fullness of the day so loudly saturated with drive and activity. 

The New Moon happens in the tropical sign of Pisces which apart from the Sun and the Moon also hosts **retrograde Mercury** and **direct Neptune**. It’s worth remembering that **Pisces is the last sign of this astrological year** as the Sun crosses the Pisces–Aries boundary on March, 19 — the day of the Equinox. The next **New Moon moment takes place on March, 24** — in the **vicinity of the Vernal Equinox**. 

This last lunation has some special meaning: it **wraps up the astrological year; and it launches us into the next turn** of the endless spiral of human development. I believe that there are clear **signs of challenges and opportunities**. The chart is rather explicit about that — the **Black Moon and Chiron conjunction** is tight and holds a **square to the destiny line** of the lunar Nodes. Down the page I will attempt to talk a bit more about this unique time period.

What a sound personal strategy could be? I’d say not to worry too much about Mercury being retrograde (which lasts until March, 9) yet **focus on your own “shadow”** or simply speaking reviewing your own past and see where your choices could be holding you back especially in anything that has to do with personal history of passion and inter-personal relationships that may have even taken some violent forms, either physical or emotional — yes, **Mars is on the South Node and will be conjunct to Pluto during the next New Moon**. That’s where Chiron offers a pathway towards resolution and healing!
