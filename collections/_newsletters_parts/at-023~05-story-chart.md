The month of **October is influenced by both Uranus and Mars** so be prepared for things that unfold in an unconventional and fiery manner.

Uranus will be activated by both the Moon’s square on October 21 shortly after its Last Quarter and by the **New Moon on October 27 which takes place at pretty much exact opposition to Uranus** with an orb of only one-fifth of a degree — just a hair away!

At this stage **Mars will be equally exact square to Saturn** and will begin its **square aspect with Pluto** that will culminate on **November 5**.

In other words, the second half of October and the first weeks of November come with a warning sign. **Don’t “speed” your life, “drive” it carefully keeping awareness of each moment**. Mars and Pluto forces are on their high tide marks and, if one is careless, Uranus may easily introduce detonating sparks.

Paradoxically, unexpected difficulties during this period may originate from **unresolved fears and inhibitions** — and we all have them! Stuff-ups tend to happen when one’s cautious attitude is due to underlying fears as opposed to confident appreciation of the reality and mature respect of personal limits — defined by the “here and now” world and family contexts we inhabit.

### Moon and Pluto — visible and hidden

**Anything that Pluto touches often implodes or becomes hidden** away from the light of consciousness. Either way we have to deal with the powers governing the unconscious and deep remote principles that influence our destinies as if from the mind-boggling domain of quantum paradoxes. 

**At the time of the Full Moon**, the Moon’s brightest and fullest phase is being directly challenged by the power of absolute blackness. The Moon–Pluto square isn’t just the point of conflict between what’s seen and its invisible subterranean counterpart. It’s a paradoxical **tension between the two kinds of fullness**. 

True to its nature, the **Moon’s fullness is fluid and emotional**. The fullness of **Pluto dwells in the domain of extreme denseness** — think the energy stored in Plutonium — where the matter is approaching its peak compression, staying just a hair away from nuclear fission. 

While the Moon–Pluto aspects challenge us emotionally, they equally **bring out the depths of personality**. They connect human emotional landscape with the energies of subterranean forces, resulting in otherwise hidden desires being reflected in waking consciousness. **Pluto–Moon people have rich sexuality, they are interested in all things occult and secret**, yet they also can be manipulative and display wide swings in their methods and preferences. Pluto-Moon aspects equally bring complications and outbursts of creativity.
