**Chiron, the wounded healer**, has crossed the Aries cusp four weeks ago on Feb, 17 and now the Sun that has just moved into Aries is on its way to exact conjunction with Chiron due Wednesday, March, 22.

The **Sun-Chiron conjunction** is likely to bring up some aspects related to **deeper personal wounds** or **certain disabilities** that prevent each of us from functioning at 100% of our capacity.

The fire of the Sun can highlight those deficiencies and one may start feeling like “no way, I can’t do that”. On the other hand, that’s all about us **accepting our limits**. This conjunction can give us the key to unlock the hidden drawer. Before anything can be healed **one must see the the wound**. 

There is a wisdom of saying “okay, I have got something, **let’s just hold it and keep moving regardless**”. Then the healing energy of the Sun can work its wonders!

On a lighter note, we’re currently having a **Mercury-Neptune conjunction** that will become exact on March, 24. It’s a wonderful time to **explore the wonders of your inner galaxies**. For a good story about the Neptunian energies, head over to our recent story [“Annual Sun – Neptune conjunction of 2019 — divine magnificence and bottomless delusions”](/posts/astrology/event/2019/03/04/annual-sun-neptune-conjunction.html) and enjoy deep waters!
