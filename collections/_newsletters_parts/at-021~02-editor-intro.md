I had such a strong pull to skip writing this email, yet nevertheless here we go… There are clearly certain astrological forces that push us away from doing planned work and pull our attention towards more adventurous, novel and exciting activities. One of such forces is **current Full Moon** that falls on September, 13 and **coincides with its Apogee**, meaning that the Moon isn’t only full, it’s also **conjunct with the Black Moon**.

The Full Moon on its Apogee is perhaps the best time to **experience and “see” the mysterious Black Moon** which is the point on the celestial sphere where the Moon is at its furthest distance from the Earth. Perhaps less chances to go crazy? Energetically speaking this Full Moon could be somewhat subdued in its outright expression but since the lunar fullness is directed towards its black sibling, one may experience intense personal pulls and pushes that come from much deeper layers of subconscious that are governed by the Black Moon — the “shadow” that reveals itself through coming a bit closer to the surface of waking consciousness.

We’ve been culturally conditioned to understand that “shadow” is something inherently “bad”. That’s not really the case with the Black Moon — its immense depths that are like a **portal to the alter ego, the better or worse yet definitely never boring self** that has much punch and pep we often miss when dealign with daily routine.

Since this “risen from the depths” Full Moon is also happening aligned with Neptune, we may only wonder what kind of idealistic attitudes may tint our experiences, for better or for worse. The good thing is that the Sun–Mars conjunction — that is never short of drive and fire — **actively opposes and challenges Neptunian marshes of dreamy self-delusion and procrastination**, equally amplified by Jupiter square to both opposites. There are astral energies in plenty and I wish each of us to use this celestial phenomenon for the best results in personal development and shaping one’s own future… in a reliable manner.

Persevering,<br>
