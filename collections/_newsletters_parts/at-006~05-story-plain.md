A case in point, as I have mentioned a couple of issues back, anything Uranian usually affects the electric and erratic side of Elon Musk. Tesla is a great company that is under direct rulership of Uranus for good and for bad — **Uranus rules over electricity and innovation**.
 
Uranian influence was swift and sudden: on February 20 Elon Musk tweeted **inflated production forecast** in his usual mischievous manner. Yesterday it was announced that SEC is taking an action against him because his false statement actively mislead the market, the company **shares tumbled instantly by 3.6%**.

On the company note we just witnessed a truly freaky Tesla car accident in Florida February 25 when the car smashed into the tree and was **engulfed in huge flames**. The driver, who was possibly dead on impact, could not be removed from the fiery inferno and was incinerated. The reason? It was **not possible to open the doors** as Tesla cars don’t have mechanical door handles. The new technology gone terribly wrong with Mars (direct fire) plus Uranus (sudden electric shock) conjunction fitting this event more than 100%.
