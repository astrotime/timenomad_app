The previous issue discussed [how the four Elements rule over the Zodiac signs](/newsletters/2019-02-27-astrology-today-issue-006.html).

The one before looked into [understanding planetary cycles: applying and separating aspects](/newsletters/2019-02-19-astrology-today-issue-005.html).

In the past we analysed [waxing and waning aspects](/newsletters/2019-02-12-astrology-today-issue-004.html) in the context of planetary cycles.

[Mars – Pluto squares of 2019 and the politics of nuclear warfare](/newsletters/2019-02-05-astrology-today-issue-003.html) was an interesting foray into the world of big politics.

We touched on a topic of an archetype of love triangle, or [why Jupiter and Venus always in love](/newsletters/2019-01-29-astrology-today-issue-002.html).

We also talked about manifestations of [the signs of the Zodiac in the human body](/newsletters/2019-01-21-astrology-today-issue-001.html).
