We have left tumultuous July behind and currently are in the process of embarking on our new lunar cycle — the New Moon of July 31 marks beginning of the **lunation that conveniently overlaps with the entire month of August**. What kind of August will that be?

Completion of July lunation coincides with **Mercury turning back to its direct course**, a breath of relief as I’ve heard from many people that this Mercury retrograde period introduced some tangible turmoil. Although I suspect that was also **Uranus influence** that was excessively pronounced throughout the month of July.

**Uranus turns retrograde** on August 11 and hopefully brings some cooling down and reduction in unexpected surprises. Perhaps marking a certain degree of **return to traditional values** in the spheres of character and rational thinking via its square with Mercury. 

Later down the page we’ll look into the **blessings and dangers of an ongoing Sun–Venus conjunction** followed by passions of upcoming **Mars–Venus alignment**… as the month of August will be gradually maxing out into stronger libido and hot impulses of all kinds.

Perhaps the most puzzling feature of the current chart is the **Black Moon that is steadily approaching Neptune**. Being the emanation of the invisible itself, the Black Moon is the focus of the featured article where I will attempt to shed some astrological light on this “object”, or more precisely the lack of it!
