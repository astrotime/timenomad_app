An **extra strong Moon energy** impressed itself upon me as I was walking last night along the bay. Not even 100% full, the Moon shone like a true midnight sun and made me twitch, “should I put some sunscreen on?”

Jokes aside, the upcoming Full Moon of 19 February delivers some powerful astral forces. This event has been categorised as **“supermoon”**, **“snow moon”** and **“hunger moon”** — all at once — not for nothing!

It is called “supermoon” because the Moon will be at its **closest distance to the Earth**, meaning the Moon will be **14% bigger** and whopping **30% brighter**. The next supermoon will only happen in 7 years time (2026).

The **“snow moon”** and **“hunger moon”** names originate from the **North American folklore** and refer to the time of the year when it snows a lot and food supply is scarce till next spring. Perhaps that isn’t that much relevant in the current age of globalisation.

But there is more… As the last night Moon felt unusually imposing, plus some of my friends displayed certain signs of completely irrational emotionality, I have decided to dig deeper… and voila, here is the culprit — **the ever mysterious Black Moon**.

Scroll down to read about the **Black Moon** in the _Astrological Comment_ section.

Stay cool,<br>
