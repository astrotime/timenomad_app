We are still moving through the **critical Mars – Uranus conjunction**. I have seen sparks flying and have been hit by a couple myself, _it was ouch_. Same happened to most of my friends. Anything Uranian unavoidably comes with a warning sign of **“Be ready for unexpected”**. Mars – Uranus conjunction effects will be gradually fading **towards the end of February**. But still, it’s _not advisable to undertake any careless act_s especially those that have to do with physical activities, sports and any kind of _competitive behaviour_. **Not a good time**.
 
Now let’s look at the current chart…

#### Highlight #1 – the Black Moon

This Full Moon, which is in astrological terms means the Sun – Moon opposition, coincides with the the Black Moon conjunct to the Sun. Why is that significant? 

The Black Moon coincides with the point of the Moon’s _apogee_ — **the furthest point** from the Earth. 

The current New “Supermoon” is happening at its _perigee_ — **the closest point** to the Earth. 

And this is exactly where the **double whammy** is coming from: having a “supermoon” Full Moon always means that the Black Moon is conjunct to the Sun.

Symbolically, the **Black Moon stands for remote, dark and hidden** side of human psyche. The Black Moon knows how to keep its secrets in the deep layers of human subconscious. 

Having the Sun conjunct to this powerful astrological point means that a lot of hidden, often intense and highly “unpleasant”, **emotional stuff gets reflected into the Full Moon**, akin to a powerful torch that blasts a polished mirror. And it hurts.

It is also a potent time to reflect about what **subconscious decisions and negative patterns** prevent you from achieving what you need to achieve — because you can see them better in the reflection of the Black Moon.

#### Highlight #2 — Regulus, the star

The Full Moon is conjunct with the star **Regulus**, a beautiful triple star of white an ultramarine hue. Regulus is located in the **heart of the constellation Leo** and symbolises courage and honour.

With the Moon, Regulus brings public prominence and powerful friends but also presents danger from false friends and outright enemies.

It’s good to keep your eyes open and, above all, **use discernment** during this emotional Full Moon.
 
#### Highlight #3 — Venus between Pluto and Saturn

The influential cluster of the South Node, Pluto, Venus and Saturn keeps evolving.

We are certainly graced by **Venus finally taking a position between Pluto and Saturn**. That should bring both **softening and high creative insights**.

At the same time Venus is also in an applying conjunction with Pluto. **Venus – Pluto conjunction** manifests forces of deep attraction in the areas of both sexuality and money. **The planet of beauty visiting the domain of lower chakras** brings the power of irresistible attraction.
