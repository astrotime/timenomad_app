**Each new Moon comes to you with an invitation to pause, revisit and realign...**

It’s a natural phase of darkness and stillness, time of emptiness and inner silence… For your psyche it’s the best time to dive deeper and reach out to your inner truth and set up the impulse for the next Moon cycle.

Time to put things in motion. **You have 48 hours once the New Moon has happened.**

Did you know that you can unite the stillness of the New Moon with the magic of crystals to support you on your journey through the next Moon cycle? **Crystals are super powerful when it comes to manifestation.** They can help you harness the opportunities and stay connected with your intention by supporting your energy and focusing your consciousness on what you want to achieve. But you really need to want it!

**So how do you work with the crystals during New Moon?**

Take your time to reflect on what needs to change in your life. What are those new opportunities, situations and relationships you want to welcome, what kind of new project you want to engage in? Re-evaluate where you are and where you want to be in a month’s time and how you want to feel there. Be honest with yourself.

Then **choose a crystal that feels right for what you want to manifest.** Here you have to trust your intuition. Let yourself be guided by your impressions — colour, texture, special vibe, shape of the stone… whatever resonates with you and what you liked about this mineral sample. What really matters here is the right motivation and inspiration that you feel when you look at the stone or a piece of gemstone jewellery. It should be aligned with you New Moon impulse.

Next, **project your New Moon intention into your crystal** while holding it in your hands. Allow the crystal to absorb your intention, charge the stone with your aspiration. Feel the resonance between you, the intention and the crystal. Gemstones are incredible powerhouses that can accumulate and focus the energy and then support us on the journey to our goals.

Finally, **make this charged crystal your companion for the next Moon cycle.** Whatever this crystal be — a gemstone jewellery piece you wear or a stone in your pocket — actively reconnect with the crystal during the day. Each time the **gemstone will reflect back to you the energy of your intention**, recharging your motivation. So this is how you can channel the energy and stay focused. Remember, energy flows where intention goes!

Here are **some gemstones that may help you connect** with the particular planetary forces and manifest your intentions.
