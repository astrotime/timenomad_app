### The Moon Nodes & their direction

The true nodes of the Moon change their direction on a regular basis, at least once a month. 

As natural retrograde (clockwise) movement of the nodes becomes reverted, their astrological influence becomes more apparent.

The _Moon Nodes Direction_ add-on reveals this nodal dynamic.

The main add-on functionality can be accessed via the _Dashboard_:

* configurable for either/or/both tropical and sidereal Zodiac models (use the _Show_ menu in the bottom left corner)
* supports single tap to reveal detailed report
* supports long-tap to reveal corresponding charts (if the _Chart Event Explorer_ add-on is active)

The add-on is smoothly integrated into the whole of the _Time Nomad_ app:

* _Summary_, including sending event notifications
* _World events_ timeline
* Current chart, chart of transits and natal chart
* Numerical chart event details (tap the date)
* Aspects and transits listings
* The _Current Chart_ widget for the Home screen

To activate the add-on use _“Add-ons”_ under the top right corner menu.
