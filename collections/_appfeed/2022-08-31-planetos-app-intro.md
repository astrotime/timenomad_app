### Poetic dive into the language of symbols

Symbolism and its language is the engine behind insights and intuitions. It brings the sense of wonder and discovery into otherwise common and opaque life experiences.

I have spend a good amount of time learning to “see” things by building verbal bridges that create flows between the image and the layers of deeper associations flowing behind the facade.

Subscribe to _Planetos_ and start receiving short poetic visual snippets, at most once a week. Poetry is food for the soul!

It’s been almost two years since I’ve started publishing _Planetos_ and I am still immensely enjoying the process of “deciphering” the images. All photographs are made by me for the purpose of being used in my writings.

Sometimes I take breaks and go away to meditate, those are the weeks of welcomed silence.

The posts are very short and easy to digest. The reader’s experience will evolve with time. So will your field of vision.

Cheers & enjoy,  
Denis
