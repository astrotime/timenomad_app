### An immersive high-definition photographic dive into nature.

**It’s free**. A virtual gallery made out of passion.

_Planetos_ is my artistic endeavour, a virtual space filled with nature images that I’ve made over the years.

It‘s a different kind of user experience, a visual gallery with an “atmosphere” that immerses the viewer into a flow of images.

No distractions, no ads and no practical purpose. Just pure experience. There has to be space for impractical things in life.

That’s the app where’s nothing “to do” but allowing the experience to shape your consciousness. Mother Nature gets it right every time.

**High quality uncompressed true-to-nature** images can work wonders on your state of mind.

## Original photography

All photographs are crafted by myself exclusively for the _Planetos_ app. No stock photography of any kind is being used.

Regular nature photography has been the source of my inspiration for a number of years and I want to share that feeling with you.

## Plus a newsletter on visual symbolism

Symbolism and its language is the “big thing” that drives interpretation of astrological charts. That's how I learn to “see” things in the chart — by building visual correspondences.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Angel‘s wings on Planetos <a href="https://t.co/7fiXjCjC8k">https://t.co/7fiXjCjC8k</a></p>&mdash; deze (@deze333) <a href="https://twitter.com/deze333/status/1565664996163567616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The newsletter is experimental. I won‘t talk astrology as such but rather immerse into the art of visual association. Pretty much everything we see has a hidden — or “occult” in the original meaning of the word — meaning behind it. Deciphering the language of symbols is the domain I‘d like to explore.

Cheers & enjoy,
