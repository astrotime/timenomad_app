## Why astrology?

Third eye meditation and astrology go together exceptionally well. 

Visionary astrologers get their insights by directing the perception of the chart through their third eye. A circle of the chart meets the tunnel of the third eye. You see deeper, you get insights that no logical mind can reach. Yes, of course, it's esoteric just as astrology is!

## What's offered

A **single purchase complete course** for the third eye mediation training. Meaning no subscriptions involved, you pay once. The course is 30+ days long.

A **free demo session** is provided. Try before you buy.

## About the third eye meditation

Activate and explore your third eye, the mysterious gateway to deep mediation and inner vision.

Learn how to relax and destress using your third eye centre of energy. The app teaches your the process of activation of the third eye — the energy centre between the eyebrows. The third eye is the classical gateway to experience of transcendental peace, calm and wellbeing.

The third eye meditation is one of the most simple yet immensely effective meditative techniques. The third eye centre of energy is always with you — simply close your eyes and it will readily activate itself. It’s an easy practice for alleviating stress and anxiety, bringing the state of wellbeing and relaxation.
