### An immersive high-definition photographic dive into nature.

**It’s free**. Made out of passion.

Open the _Planetos_ app each day to discover a new set of original photography that is designed to put you in the state of flow. Or bring peace. Or take your mind on a creative journey.

That’s the app where’s nothing “to do” but allowing the experience to shape your consciousness. Mother Nature gets it right every time.

High quality uncompressed true-to-nature images can work wonders on your state of mind.

## Original photography

All photographs are taken & processed by myself, exclusively for the _Planetos_ app. No stock photography of any kind is being used.

Regular nature photography has been the source of my inspiration for a number of years and I want to share that feeling with you.

## Relaxation & creative stimulation

Zone-out and let your mind drift through animated visual sequences of full resolution quality visual sequences.

Creativity flows when your mind is free from stress and anxiety of the modern world. Nothing induces that better than mother nature. Allow yourself a 5-10 minute session to discover that precious feeling.

## Make inspired notes

Whenever you‘re experiencing a flow of ideas write a quick note for yourself by returning the app to portrait view and tapping on ”Write a Note” in the main menu.

All notes are stored in your iCloud account and are truly yours, no external storage or signing up is involved. Your notes remain yours.
