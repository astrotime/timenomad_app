## Using Planetary Hours calculator

The default view is the watch face that displays planetary hours in the circular arrangement with the lower darker portion of the circle representing night time, and the upper white part of the circle representing day time hours.

Note that the sequence of planetary hours is “disconnected” at the bottom of the watch face that corresponds to midnight. The planetary hours from the sunset to midnight belong to the current day. But the planetary hours after midnight actually belong to the previous day, those are the hours that precede the sunrise of the current day.

The **planetary day of the week** is identified by the planet at the moment of sunrise. On the screenshot above Saturn is the planet that rules Saturday.

Use the “**Date**” button to move to any date of your choice. Note that that date will be within the time zone that is defined by the currently active profile. If planetary hours for a different geographic location are required, simply choose one of corresponding profiles.

Use the **scroller below the watch face** to move to different screens that offer more specific functionality.

## Planetary hours for the day

This screen presents a more detailed information about all planetary hours for any given “today” in a convenient table format that gets calculated updated in real-time.

The current planetary hour is automatically highlighted. Each planetary hour has its starting and ending time conveniently presented in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.

The list of planetary hours is a powerful tool if you need to plan your day in accordance with certain hours.

## Heptagrams and the dominant planet

The two heptagrams  screens calculate a graphical view of the sequence of planetary hours for the given time and geographic location.

There are two types of heptagrams:

* Planets connected following the sequence of planetary days of the week
* Planets connected following the sequence of planetary hours

The heptagrams allow to identify the dominant planet for that specific time:

* Planet at the top is always extra strong
* Planet that is at the centre of symmetry, if any, is strong

To learn more about the heptagrams, read the mini series [What is Planetary Hours]({% post_url 2018-11-23-what-is-planetary-hours-part-one %}) that takes a deep dive into the fascinating topic of time, numerology, planetary spheres and planetary hours.

## Planetary hours alarm

Planetary hours alarm allows to stay notified about planetary hours changes. The alarm will produce a notification with a unique sound for each of the seven classical planets.

To access the alarm functionality move the slider all the way to the left.

The alarm has two modes:

**Recurrent alarm mode** will be running every day as long as the app is periodically activated. You will be reminded if you device is about to run out of alarms. Recurrent alarm is scheduled on “from – to” basis staring no earlier than the “earliest time” specified and last alarm for a day will not sound later than “latest time” specified in the user interface.

**Today only** alarm is useful if you only interested in the current day. The alarm will produce notifications starting from the current moment and until the latest time specified.

Planetary hours alarm can be further configured by selecting what planetary hours you are interested to be notified about.

In some situations it makes sense to only receive, for example, the Sun hour and the Moon hour. Another example could be that only Saturn hour alarms are of interest. Any combination of planets is allowed.
