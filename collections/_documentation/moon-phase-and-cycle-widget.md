* Solar-lunar arc, ie the angle between the Sun and the Moon
* Past and upcoming Moon phase
* Complete Moon lunation timeline, from last New Moon to next New Moon
* Solar and lunar eclipses that may take place during current lunation, including eclipse types
* Moon‘s current applying and separating conjunctions with planets and points of a chart
* Future and past conjunctions with planets
* Moon‘s current transit through constellations
* Moon‘s current conjunctions with fixed stars in the vicinity of the ecliptic

### 1\. Lock Screen widget — Luminaries

Lock Screen with all three widgets added. Peruse [Apple online guide](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118610) on how to add widgets to the Lock Screen.

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-lock-screen-04.png" srcset="/images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-lock-screen-04.png 1x, /images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-lock-screen-04@2x.png 2x" alt="Lock Screen rectangluar accessory widget displaying Sun and Moon zodiac signs, degrees and a solar-lunar arc which is the angle between the Sun and the Moon.">

The super compact ”above the clock” rectangluar accessory widget displaying current values for:

* Zodiac sign and degree of the Sun
* Zodiac sign and degree of the Moon
* Angle between the Moon and the Sun, aka the solar-lunar arc

There are **two versions** of the widget, install the one that matches your preferred sodiac system:

* Tropical zodiac system
* Sidereal zodiac system

### 2\. Lock Screen widget — Moon phase

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-lock-screen-02.png" srcset="/images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-lock-screen-02.png 1x, /images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-lock-screen-02@2x.png 2x" alt="Moon phase  widget displaying partial lunar eclipse and total solar eclipse.">

Moon phase widget displaying partial lunar eclipse and total solar eclipse.

The widget highlights current intermediary phase and shows the countdown to the next phase.

Solar and lunar eclipses are indicated by corresponding icons and a short legend. Scroll to the bottom of this guide for the full explanation of eclipses.

### 3\. Lock Screen widget — Moon conjuncitons

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-lock-screen-03.png" srcset="/images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-lock-screen-03.png 1x, /images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-lock-screen-03@2x.png 2x" alt="Widget displaying conjunctions of the Moon with planets, fixed stars and Moon constellation transit.">

Moon phase widget displaying current planetary conjunctions, separating fixed star conjunction and current constellation traversed by the Moon.

The top row shows planets with which the Moon is currently conjuncts. Dimmed planets indicate future/past conjunctions accompanied by the day count. 

The bottom row is about constellations traversed by the Moon and fixed stars that the Moon is passing by. Constellation passages are based on visual observations, meaning how the observer perceives the segments of the night sky and their boundaries. Hence Scorpius is used as a complete visual segment and not subdivided into Ophiuchus that is barely visible to the observer. That’s an invitation to the user to spend some nights observing the constellations of the Zodiac.

## Home Screen widgets

Several sizes of widgets present different amount of visual information, the user is welcome to add the one (or several) that suit the taste and screen estate.

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/docs/moon-cycle-widgets-home-screen-01.png" srcset="/images/docs/moon-cycle-widgets-home-screen-01.png 1x, /images/docs/moon-cycle-widgets-home-screen-01@2x.png 2x" alt="Large, medium and small size Home Screen Widget displaying Moon phase along with additional parameters.">

All widgets can be configured with a long-tap followed by the “Edit widget” (or similar) menu item. Configuration offers a choice between tropical and sidereal zodiac coordinates, or both for medium and large size widgets. Sidereal zodiac coordinate is indicated by the star symbol ✦ that also is used throughout the app to indicate the sidereal zodiac model.

Solar and lunar eclipses are indicated by corresponding icons and a short legend underneath. Scroll to the bottom of this guide for the full explanation of eclipses.

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-home-screen-01.png" srcset="/images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-home-screen-01.png 1x, /images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-home-screen-01@2x.png 2x" alt="Small size Home Screen Widget displaying Moon phase along with additional parameters.">

Small size widget packs a lot of information in a concise format.

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-home-screen-02.png" srcset="/images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-home-screen-02.png 1x, /images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-home-screen-02@2x.png 2x" alt="Medium size Home Screen Widget displaying Moon phase along with additional parameters.">

Medium size widget.

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-home-screen-03.png" srcset="/images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-home-screen-03.png 1x, /images/docs/moon-cycle-widget-home-screen-03@2x.png 2x" alt="Large size Home Screen Widget displaying Moon phase along with additional parameters.">

Large size widget is the most informative. Additional information includes:

* the Moon’s distance from the Earth. **Perigee** (P) is the closest while **apogee** (A) is the furthest
* the Moon’s passages over the **ascending** and **descending** lunar nodes, aka the North Node and the South Node
* the Moon’s **rise, transit and set** which may happen on the current or following day(s) in the current user geographic location

### Enabling geographic location

Moon rise, transit and set times require the knowledge of user geographic location coordinates. Detailed information on how to enable either automatic or manual geo location can be found in the [Chart Widget guide](/documentation/current-astological-chart-widget.html).

## Eclipses

Solar eclipse can only happen during New Moon when the Moon is positioned in front of the Sun. The three types of solar eclipse:

* **Partial** (P) — the Sun is partially covered by the Moon
* **Annular** (A) — the ring like eclipse when the Moon is too small to cover the whole of the Sun
* **Total** (T) — the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon

Lunar eclipse can only happen during Full Moon when the Earth is positioned between the Sun and the Moon. The three types of lunar eclipses:

* **Penumbral** (PU) — the Moon is in the weaker part of the Earth’s shadow (penumbra)
* **Partial** (P) — the Moon is partially covered by the Earth’s shadow (umbra)
* **Total** (T) — the Moon is fully within Earth’s shadow (umbra)
