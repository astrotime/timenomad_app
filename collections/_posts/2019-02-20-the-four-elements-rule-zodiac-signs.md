title: How the four Elements rule over the Zodiac signs
description: Each and every of the four alchemical Elements — namely Fire, Earth, Water and Air — have rulership over corresponding Zodiac signs. But if we ask the question “How does it work?” it suddenly becomes not so simple. This exploration of the mysteries of the Elements and the Zodiac wheel will lead us to understanding of the principles of Cosmic Fire and Cosmic Waters.

Each of the twelve Zodiac signs are traditionally said to be ruled by one of the four alchemical Elements — Fire, Earth, Water or Air. This approach divides the whole Zodiac wheel into four groups of three signs — four Fiery signs, four Earthy signs, four Watery signs and four Airy signs.

It is simple and natural to think along the lines:

* **Aries** is a **fiery** sign, it is also ruled by **Mars**
* **Taurus** is an **earthy** sign, ruled by **Venus**
* **Gemini** is an **airy** sign, ruled by **Mercury**
* **Cancer** is a **watery** sign, ruled by the **Moon**

… and so on.

**But there is a catch!** It is not so obvious why the Zodiac signs were assigned rulership of the Elements in that specific order. What’s more, if we attempt to do it ourselves, we’re likely to not produce the same result… at least from the first attempt.

## The four Elements

Many an alchemical treatise state that there are four Elements and all things made out of combination of those. Every body is a combination of certain amounts of fire, earth, water and air.

Some time ago we have discussed the Elements in the story ["The four Elements and their powers"]({% post_url 2018-10-28-four-elements-and-their-powers %}). The story touched upon the basic qualities of the Elements: Fire is hot, Earth is dry, Water is cold, Air is moist.

The Elements are not static, they are transmutable, meaning that applying certain forces one element can be transformed into its neighbour:

1. **Fire** when _cooled_ becomes **Earth**
2. **Earth** when _dissolved_ becomes **Water**
3. **Water** when _evaporated_ becomes **Air**
4. **Air** when _kindled_ becomes **Fire**

**Is reverse possible?** Yes, it is possible albeit not as “natural”. This is what the modern physics is dabbling with:

4. **Fire** when _extinguished_ becomes **Air**
3. **Air** when _condensed_ becomes **Water**
2. **Water** when _hardened and thickened_ becomes **Earth**
1. **Earth** when _shattered via nuclear power_ becomes **Fire**

The natural cycle of `Fire ➝ Earth ➝ Water ➝ Air` makes sense from the physical standpoint:

<img class="lazyload" data-srcset="/images/illustrations/the-four-elements-cycle.png 1x, /images/illustrations/the-four-elements-cycle@2x.png 2x, /images/illustrations/the-four-elements-cycle@3x.png 3x" alt="The cycle of the elements and their qualities">

The `Fire ➝ Earth ➝ Water ➝ Air` sequence is the basis of many natural cycles:

* seasonal cycle
* day and night cycle

The story about [“ubiquitous cycles of everything”]({% post_url 2018-11-15-astrology-cycles-of-elements %}) has explored this topic in depth.

Now that we are equipped with the `Fire ➝ Earth ➝ Water ➝ Air` (or FEWA) sequence, let’s try to wrap it around the Zodiac circle.

# First attempt to assign the Elements

As we always do, let’s begin from Aries since it’s the Vernal Equinox sign and is usually associated with the number one.

Using the usual `Fire ➝ Earth ➝ Water ➝ Air` (FEWA) sequence gives us a problem right away: Gemini isn’t watery and Cancer isn’t airy! Cancer is ruled by the Moon and is watery, while Gemini is airy.

<img class="lazyload snake-tail" data-srcset="/images/illustrations/zodiac-and-elements-distribution-correct.png 1x, /images/illustrations/zodiac-and-elements-distribution-correct@2x.png 2x, /images/illustrations/zodiac-and-elements-distribution-correct@3x.png 3x" alt="Distribution of the Elements along the Zodiac circle, correct version">

The correct sequence turns out to be `Fire ➝ Earth ➝ Air ➝ Water` (or FEAW). But this sequence “breaks” the natural order of the transmutations of the Elements. Where is the problem?

## The unity of Cosmic Fire and Cosmic Waters

It turns out that the key to solve this Zodiacal puzzle is contained in the story [“How the classical planets rule the zodiac signs.”]({% post_url 2018-10-05-how-classical-planets-rule-zodiac %})

In anything metaphysical or alchemical, a useful reminder is to always start with the state of unity and then gradually introduce duality.

Unity is represented by a circle, it has no beginning and no end, no side can be truly left or truly right. The circle symbolises a state of undifferentiated equilibrium.

To achieve the state of duality and thus “kickstart” the manifested universe, we need to draw a line that would split the circle into two halves, or polarities. Those polarities will represent light and darkness, day and night, masculine and feminine, fire and water principles.

Symbolically this line can be drawn between the signs of Cancer and Leo. It makes sense since Leo is ruled by the Sun and Cancer is ruled by the Moon. This way we are beginning with the two luminaries that rule over both day and night.

<img class="lazyload" data-srcset="/images/illustrations/zodiac-ruling-planets-1.png 1x, /images/illustrations/zodiac-ruling-planets-1@2x.png 2x, /images/illustrations/zodiac-ruling-planets-1@3x.png 3x" alt="Zodiac ruling planets">

The Sun entering the tropical sign of Cancer marks the beginning of summer (the 22nd of June) when the warmth arrives. Then follows the tropical sign of Leo (the 23rd of July) with its heat.

Equipped with this new model, we can venture forward and make the second attempt at distributing the Elements along the Zodiac wheel.

<img class="lazyload" data-srcset="/images/illustrations/zodiac-and-elements-distribution-step-1.png 1x, /images/illustrations/zodiac-and-elements-distribution-step-1@2x.png 2x, /images/illustrations/zodiac-and-elements-distribution-step-1@3x.png 3x" alt="Distribution of the Elements around the Zodiac wheel, step 1">

The sign of Cancer ruled by the Moon receives the Water Element. The sign of Leo ruled by the Sun receives the Fire Element. What’s next?

Following the circle of transmutations of the Elements, fire gets cooled into the earth, water gets evaporated into the air.

And that’s pretty much it, we can repeat the letters around the circle to get the full mapping of the Elements to the Zodiac signs.

<img class="lazyload" data-srcset="/images/illustrations/zodiac-and-elements-distribution-step-3.png 1x, /images/illustrations/zodiac-and-elements-distribution-step-3@2x.png 2x, /images/illustrations/zodiac-and-elements-distribution-step-3@3x.png 3x" alt="Distribution of the Elements around the Zodiac wheel, step 3">

This method also produced a nice three-fold division of the circle along the fire-water boundaries. In ancient mythology the two core principles — one of **Cosmic Fire** and another of **Cosmic Waters** — are seen as the foundational forces out of which everything has been created. Both duality and unity of _God-father_ and _God-mother_.

## Introducing Triplicities

Grouping of the twelve Zodiac signs in accordance with the four Elements produces four groups of three signs that are called the triplicities.

Each triplicity corresponds to one of the Elements. The Zodiac signs within each triplicity are ruled by the Elements and receive their energy in a distributed manner:

1. **Aries** is the beginning of **fire**, **Leo** is the progress and increase, **Sagittarius** is the end.

2. **Taurus** is the beginning of the **earth**, **Virgo** is the progress and increase, **Capricorn** is the end.

3. **Gemini** is the beginning of the **air**, **Libra** is the progress and increase, **Aquarius** is the end.

4. **Cancer** is the beginning of **water**, **Scorpio** is the progress and increase, **Pisces** is the end.

<img class="lazyload snake" data-srcset="/images/illustrations/zodiac-triplicity-earth.png 1x, /images/illustrations/zodiac-triplicity-earth@2x.png 2x, /images/illustrations/zodiac-triplicity-earth@3x.png 3x" alt="The Zodiac triplicity of Earth. The signs of Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn.">

<img class="lazyload snake" data-srcset="/images/illustrations/zodiac-triplicity-air.png 1x, /images/illustrations/zodiac-triplicity-air@2x.png 2x, /images/illustrations/zodiac-triplicity-air@3x.png 3x" alt="The Zodiac triplicity of Air. The signs of Gemini, Libra, Aquarius.">

<img class="lazyload snake-tail" data-srcset="/images/illustrations/zodiac-triplicity-water.png 1x, /images/illustrations/zodiac-triplicity-water@2x.png 2x, /images/illustrations/zodiac-triplicity-water@3x.png 3x" alt="The Zodiac triplicity of Water. The signs of Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces.">

An interesting observation is that this time fire starts with Aries, how come? It does make sense since Aries, being the sign of vernal Equinox, marks the beginning of spring when the fire of the Sun starts to melt frozen waters. The sign of Leo, or rather Leo – Cancer boundary, marks the culmination of the movement of fire.

## The two lines to remember

A good reflection that follows out of this story is that in astrology we tend to mostly take the Aries – Pisces division as the foundational “zero” point. Bringing the Leo – Cancer dividing line into our awareness enables astrologers to fully address the notions of unity and duality — as well as masculine – feminine dialectic of cosmic creative principles behind any astrological chart.
