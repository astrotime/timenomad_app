title: Gemstones, jewellery and sacred geometry of the Circle
description: Out of all things magical gemstones and sacred geometry are perhaps the two principles most closely related to astrology. The power of esoteric symbolism and connection to the forces of nature gave birth to jewellery many a millennia ago. We are still in love with it.

In this story we are going to look at the unique idea behind the _Dancing Orbit_ pendant collection by [Gems In Style jewellery](https://gemsinstyle.com/?utm_source=tn&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=geometry_circle){: target="_blank"}. Their designs artfully blend together **eternal elegance of the circle** and deep energies of **natural gemstones**, finely framed in sterling silver — ultimately modern and yet timeless in their simplicity.

{% include video-youtube.html id="4wlRSLQt1JM" %}

These jewellery designs were inspired by the circular geometry upholding **movements of celestial bodies** — the blueprint behind any astrological chart. The _Dancing Orbit_ collection symbolises eternal ebb and flow of time and seasons of the nature, that reaches its fullness during the summer solstice and then gradually starts receding towards the depths of the night and the forces of sleep and rejuvenation.

Each of _Dancing Orbit_ pendants carries a carefully selected and precisely cut natural gemstone that is big enough so that the wearer can **tune into its essence and actually feel the powers** behind each gem they are wearing on their heart chakra. The _Dancing Orbit_ collection is not only aesthetically pleasing and modern in its design, it also touches the wearer with its supportive and protective energies.

Let us go through each of gemstones… 

## Lapis Lazuli — the “alpha” of all magic

Lapis Lazuli is perhaps the undeniably “alpha” gemstone when it comes all things magical and astrological. Adored and respected since the times immemorial, lapis lazuli combines deep blue of astral spaces with golden speckles that bring sharpness to vision and enhance intuition.
