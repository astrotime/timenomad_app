## Why Time Nomad is so convenient?

Time Nomad was created with the intention to give you a tool that would enable you to better understand the dynamics of celestial bodies and their corresponding astrological meaning and interpretation. The app is a perfect companion for astrologers of any level — from **a student who is beginning to learn astrology to a professional astrologer** offering clients' charts reading and using prediction techiniques.

Time Nomad keeps you in touch with ever changing configuration of planets, minor bodies and asteriods. It’s a modern astrological tool designed to be in your pocket and give you **answers in real time**. Astronomical and astrological information is presented in unadorned, concise yet expressive manner to help you see the bigger picture.

Time Nomad comes with useful iOS **event notifications** that notify about upcoming events — in advance — aspects, transits, solar and lunar returns, phases of the Moon and Moon Void of Course.

The app supports both **tropical and sidereal Zodiac**. The sidereal Zodiac reporting comes with a variety of ayanamsa.
