  If one has a malefic star right above their home city in their Astro map will
  its influence be lessend if the person relocates away from it? I have an
  otherwise positive Jupiter MC line but this star gives "depression", and
  another nearby star says I'll be "rubbing other the wrong way". It is true, I
  made more friends in a city away from those star lines. So the implications of
  fixed stars for AstroCartoGraphy are huge.
