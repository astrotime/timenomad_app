  It's more like the North North is conjunct to Rigel. It's a significant star
  by itself but it's a bit too far from the ecliptic (~30ยบ) which makes its
  conjunctions more of a diffused nature. The North Node stands for the future,
  Rigel shines the light of aspiration and revelation. Perhaps it's a good idea
  to spend time stargazing on the star, making it a kind of a recurring ritual.
  You may get some ideas out of that.
