message: "Well I ordered the book on fixed stars and constellations you recommended because while\r\nI already knew my sun in 9th Cancer ( born July 6th) was conjunct exactly with Sirius which \r\nhave long felt connected to,  then last night following Full Moon, I had dream which led me to check out the other  possible fixed stars in my chart and was stunned to learn that 9 of the 15 fixed stars listed in Astro-Seek are conjunct to at least one planet and in 3 cases two planets. They are all above the horizon as is my chart except for part of fortune conjunct Deneb Algedi in Aquarius 4th house. I see the need to get deeper into your site to better understand this.  But basically believe my life is not entirely in my hands and often helped by sychronicities and outside forces-- from Sirius and elsewhere"
