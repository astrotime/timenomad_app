message: "Hey brother when you say the zodiac 30 degree is in our imagination, I would like to offer that it is a reality of manifestation.  The sixty repeating golden ratio series laid out on a circle shows 4-0's and 8-5's at every 30 degree.  It also has the swastika/cross at the zeros. Surrounding the 0's cross is 1011 the alpha-Aries , 9099 Omega - Libra, 7077 as above and 3033 as below.  Peace and cheers. \r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hrmi5Nu0GgLEv05yphIn5US6TT4PgvNm/view?usp=sharing"
