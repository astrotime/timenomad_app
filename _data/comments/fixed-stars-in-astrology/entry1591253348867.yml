message: "The language describing fixed stars’ effects hasn’t changed for a very long time and thus shouldn’t be taken literally. A good idea would be to find modern modern equivalents to what the ancients described as death or blindness. Replace death with “existential crisis”, blindness with “lack of understanding” and it makes much more sense to the modern ear. And most of all, read the whole description to understand the bigger picture of star’s nature, then one can start connecting the dots.\r\n\r\nWorking with the fixed stars isn’t a simple and straightforward task, hence not much information available, much of the knowledge is intuitive in nature."
