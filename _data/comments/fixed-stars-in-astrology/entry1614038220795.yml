  Hard to tell without seeing the details. My first guess is to check if you're
  referring to the sidereal or tropical zodiac as those would render things
  differently. Then check the orbs for the fixed stars aspects. And finally note
  Rigel's position relative to the Ascendant. How far is it?  You can email me
  if want to take this further.
