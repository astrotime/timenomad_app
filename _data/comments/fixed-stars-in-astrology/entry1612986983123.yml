  Thanks for this, it's very helpful. I have two fixed stars in my chart in
  almost exact conjunctions. Betelgeuse conjunct Mars & Facies conjunct AC. My
  life could be perfectly charted onto your diagram of the extreme ups & then
  the dropping from great heights...it's the first time i've seen someone
  explaining the fixed stars in action like that. Not sure which of them is more
  responsible in my chart. The outer planets are all strong & hitting up my MC
  too, so i don't think i'm in it for a quiet life. I've had multiple close
  calls with electricity since a child & been hit by lightning, so that
  description of Betelgeuse / Mars is bang on for me. Also red hair & skin
  tone....
