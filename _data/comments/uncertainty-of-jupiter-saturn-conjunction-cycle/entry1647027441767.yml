  So I studied comparative politics, global finance, and political and spiritual
  ideologies. What is likely happening at the moment is the reckoning with the
  far right. Hence, comments on socialism etc by people that have absolutely no
  idea what socialism is only that they have been told it is scary in order to
  maintain the status quo, so whenever anything is being proposed to change,
  they use the word socialism to shutdown discussions about any sort of change
  or resolution to the current state of things. Science based evidence is wrong
  to them, media unless it is propaganda that supports their beliefs is wrong,
  dictionaries are wrong about what words mean, experts are wrong to them, and
  even their understanding of law means only their understanding of it is right
  even though it might be right in front of them and saying something completely
  different. Anything that is not far right enough is left even though in
  reality political ideology exists on a spectrum with centrist ideology and far
  extremes to the far left and far right. Realistically, this will be and ebb
  and flow process. Right now we are in a position of looking at what is better
  democracy aka the right to vote for all or authoritarianism where only elite
  have a voice over collective choices. Hint, authoritarianism won’t work on
  populations that have experienced democracy for generations. So the far right
  in countries with democracy will likely fail to get meaningful traction or
  will leave democracies in civil conflict. Those on the far right have no idea
  how much they have been duped because they are too afraid to see reason. They
  have no idea that the far left doesn’t really exist anymore and actually those
  historic actors morphed into a version of the far right - Cuba is excluded
  from this at the moment. So essentially at the moment we are in a place of
  democracy vs authoritarianism. Democracies have the adaptability that
  authoritarianism doesn’t have because it allows for innovation and diversity
  of views while authoritarianism suffers from leader think and has far too many
  blind spots.
