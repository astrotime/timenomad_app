message: "A lot of important questions here. Any cycle is naturally developing through milestones which are basically chapters made by significant aspects, for example, square, trine, sesquisquare, opposition and inconjunction. Each chapter can be perceived as a seasonal process where different forces interact and modify the overall cycle. And it’s not that easy to fix the action of each chapter as depends on the outcomes of the previous one. The general idea of progression through chapters can be seen in a similar way to Moon lunation: seed planted at conjunciton, negotiation at sextile, growth to active conflict at square, another negotiation at trine, sesquisquare presents unexpected challenges, inconjunciton pushes for changes and alternations, opposition forces a reboot and starts the second half of the cycle, etc.\r\n\r\nThe sidereal zodiac… I think it’s up to each individual to pick their favourite. Personally, I use both probably because I do a lot of stargazing and it’s nice to have planets more or less matching their zodiac signs. My vision is that the tropical model is more earth bound and reflects the seasonal nature of changes while the sidereal model is more abstract and subtle and perhaps not that easily translated into day to day activity. You can find my thoughts on tropical vs sidereal on my blog."
