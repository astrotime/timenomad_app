  Oh, thank you for your acknowledgment. Apparently it's just me, the developer
  of the Time Nomad app. Knowledge of astrology is a prerequisite to creating a
  meaningful astrological software. And this blog is the reflection of some of
  my understandings of celestial mechanics and symbolism that are the foundation
  of astrological knowledge.
