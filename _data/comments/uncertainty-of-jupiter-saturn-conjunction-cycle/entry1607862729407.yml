message: "Time Nomad - thank you for this timely and important gaze into the future. Some are not ready to live in discomfort and that is ok, planting the seed to prepare them for what is coming is just as important.\r\n\r\nI share the sentiment that there are many ism and in the US especially we have a hard time seeing beyond what we know to be presently true. Never have we seen a more polarizing time in our country and it is very hard to bring people to a middle ground. Your attempt at that was honest.\r\n\r\nThank you for your deep analysis, I look forward to them every time."
