  It is a timely piece. I like what you have to say. However, more care should
  be taken with grammar, punctuation, etc. The remedy is a good editor. Being an
  English teacher as well as an Astrologer and writer, it is hard for me to
  overlook the easily rectifiable. I hope you do not take criticism the wrong
  way. By the way, love the app!
