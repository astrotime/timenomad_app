  Ha, the article doesn't mention any of socialist ideas. By the way, a lot of
  futurist visions and predictions may be perceived as kind of "socialist" but
  they are not â€“ the biggest problem, especially noticeable in the US, is that
  people tend to brand as socialism everything that is different from the
  current mode of operation. Which certainly isn't true, there's lots of "isms",
  not just capitalism and socialism.
