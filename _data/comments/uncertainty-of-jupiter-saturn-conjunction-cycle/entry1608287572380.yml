  A lot of people here are overly confident, I believe, that the Age of Aquarius
  is just around the corner. I had this challenged - and my interest in
  historical events seems to confirm it - by Rudolf Steiner, who asserted that
  it takes hundreds of years before such a transition actually manifests in
  cultural and down to earth practicalities, and in the mindset of humanity. 
  This is because, one stage in evolution above us stand the personal Angel
  beings, above them are the Archangels who guide peoples, and nations (if they
  are correctly founded), and above them are the Archai (Time Spirits) who
  govern the 2000+year-epochs.  The Fourth Post-Atlantean Age began around 747
  B.C., which was the Graeco-Latin period (Greeks, Romans and in the last third
  the Church of Rome; this Romanism came to closure just before and after 1413
  A.D.  The historical signature of the next 5th Post-Atlantean Age is
  overwhelming:  the birth of the 'natural sciences' in the wider culture, as
  astrology steps down to become merely astronomy, alchemy to chemistry, etc.,
  and all attention is drawn outwards to the material world giving birth to the
  industrial revolution... Romanism is countered with the Protestant
  Reformation, beginning at the end of the medieval world, with John Wycliffe's
  English language bible, Jan Huss in Prague who challenges the Roman authority
  (unwittingly), and finally Martin Luther. This has political ramifications as
  a new age asserting individualism comes to being, politics slowly begins to
  separate from religion, and the age of Kings, Queens, Emperors, Pharoahs and
  Caesars is eclipsed.  We are still going through that transition, with
  regressive self-appointed Caesars oppose the march forward (Napoleon, Hitler
  ... and finally Chairman and Boardrooms of vast corporations - utterly
  medieval in their pyramid-like structure).  However, Steiner then asserts that
  the 2000-year epochs are subdivided by Archangelic periods of about 350 years,
  and the Age of Michael began in 1879, ending the age of nationalistic
  colonialism (Age of Gabriel - particularly important to Great Britain), for a
  more cosmopolitan epoch of Mikael.  This Mikaelic phase feels like the Age of
  Aquarius yet to come.
