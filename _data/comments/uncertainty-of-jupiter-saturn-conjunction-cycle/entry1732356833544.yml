message: "A few points to ponder upon. \r\n\r\nUranus is a very slow moving planet and its aspects last a significant amount to time. This means its aspects apply to broad societal trends rather than events afflicting specific individuals.\r\n\r\nUranus isn't a \"personal\" planet, its influence has to do with societal trends at large.\r\n\r\nAlgol is too far from ecliptic and thus conjunctions aren't as powerful as for example a conjunctions with Spica or Regulus or Antares that sit close to the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nCan the assassination attempt be an expression of a bigger societal trend? Quite possibly yes. An event like this makes more sense taking into consideration the whole split and inflamed passions of opposing factions."
