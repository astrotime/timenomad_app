  Thank you for this great overview of outer planet conjunctions & trends in the
  world economy. Can you speak to the current square of Jupiter & Saturn & have
  you looked at the opposition, sesquisquare or quincunx aspects to evaluate
  coming economic or political shifts? Also, this Uranus conjunct Algol seems
  related to the assassination attempt on Trump. I'm worried about a similar
  attempt on Harris. Do you see more damage coming from this Wild card? I just
  found your App and I intend to give it a try. Appreciate your reference to R.
  Steiner. I'm a big fan. What do you think about Astrosophy and its use of the
  Sidereal zodiac? I see you have background in Vedic astrology.. So much to
  study - always room to grow in the fathomless realm of Star Wisdom....
