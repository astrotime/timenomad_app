  I’m going to assume you are into astrology if you’re reading this. I just want
  to say; we all have energy we must work out. When you can’t read an astrology
  article without letting your societal programming tear it down with baseless
  assumptions it’s a pretty stellar reminder to find balance and acceptance over
  polarity and reaction. If we are to truly grow into this new age we should
  start with ditching the over-reactionary impulses that are only here to
  distract us from our true work and will only ever delay our growth. The same
  people responsible for you feeling so strongly about socialism would conspire
  to change your mind in the same breath if it meant keeping their power and
  wealth.
