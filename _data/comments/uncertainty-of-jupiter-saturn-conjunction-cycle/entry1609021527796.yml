  Excellent , informative response Stephen. Thank you so much for sharing your
  knowledge. Researching the essence of the Mikaelic phase should take the rest
  of the afternoon and offer great creative inspiration. An expat - now
  Demi-Ameri after 1/2 my life in California Iâ€™m highly intrigued as to how the
  empires are destined to fall or rise.
