  Thank you. Your words ring true in my own life. Uncertainty IS the name of the
  game now. I truly feel my old life is over (just finished with second Saturnâ€™s
  return). Everything feels different like I have entered a new dimension.
  Wonder and mystery are once again front and center. It is wonderful to be
  alive and to witness the conjunction tonight. It was magical to see it up in
  the sky. Possibly in the future, when conservation begins to happen we could
  have black out nights so that we can all look up to the heavens and stare in
  awe. My welcome thought for all of us for the Age of Aquarius!
