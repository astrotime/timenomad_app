  An exceptionally well-written and thoughtful article that comes to many of the
  same conclusions as another group I’m in. In addition to a worldwide economic
  breakdown and monetary restructuring w/ UBI (“great reset” of the WEF) - we
  also highlighted the potential issues for certain crypto currencies as
  national ones replace bills and coinage. Keep up the good work and thanks for
  this awesome analysis!
