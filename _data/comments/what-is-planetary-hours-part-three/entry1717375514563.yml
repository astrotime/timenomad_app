message: "Firstly, it's a question of which esoteric tradition one practices. Planetary hours belong to the Western esoteric tradition. The tattvas ... they appear in both Hinduism (tantra, shaivism, samkhya, etc) and Buddhism. There's no single accepted \"formula\" for the tattvas and their number does very.\r\n\r\nThe tattvas may be described as fundamental building blocks out of which the reality of human experience is formed. Since they are quite fine grained their application is better suited for deeper meditative practices.\r\n\r\nThe planetary hours are based on much more tangible planetary energies and their inherent cyclic sequence. \r\n\r\nThe planetary hours are easier to work with during daily awareness. The tattvas may become too \"mindy\" if used during non-meditative times simply because human consciousness is much more externalised and disconnected from the finer layers of reality. But during the periods of full time meditation one may use tattvas in a much more meaningful way compared to planetary energies."
