message: "Why is some calendar day called Tuesday and not any other day… Here’s my understanding. And I am very curious about other interpretations!\r\n\r\nThe week cycle is a fundamental principle of division of time. It’s a rhythm of succession of planetary energies that coalesce in an even larger infinitely more complex flow of time. The flow of time is something that we can only aspire to understand from the standpoint of physics. What is certain is that time is a hyper dimensional phenomenon, meaning it flows at many planes at once and thus is fiendishly difficult to grasp by an ordinary human mind.\r\n\r\nThe ancients (it believed around the times of Babylon) have received an inspiration or revelation about some aspects of the time process and the symbolic relationship of the number 7 to the phenomenon of time. Thus the 7 day week was born.\r\n\r\nPerceiving the 7 day period as a measure of rhythm allows us to get in sync with certain aspects of the flow in more harmonious ways. Yet we will never be able to sync up with the totality of it, meaning the whole cosmos. Thus having the 7 day cycle consisting of qualitatively different phases (days) of action and rest is the most harmonious way to move through time. From this standpoint it doesn’t really matter which day is the true “first” or “second” — following the principle is more important than fixing things once and forever.\r\n\r\nThat also makes sense from the hyper dimensional nature of time. We are simply picking one of many “slices” of that flow. And when billions of people doing that in unison for hundreds of years, that creates a tangible reality of the calendar and its weeks. \r\n\r\nSo, yes, I do believe any day could be Tuesday!"
