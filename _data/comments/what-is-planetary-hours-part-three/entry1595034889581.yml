message: "A very interesting point you’re raising…\r\n\r\nI don’t consider myself as being sufficiently familiar with Kabbalah so take my answer with a grain of salt. The article approaches the planetary hours from the standpoint of the Western esoteric tradition which mostly focuses on symbolic and cosmological meaning of the planets and planetary spheres. \r\n\r\nThe numbers are assigned accordingly to the speed of movement of celestial bodies, with the Moon being number 1, the fastest.\r\n\r\nYet for other applications, one may consider a different numbering, for example the Sun is 1, the Moon is 2, etc.\r\n\r\nThis illustrates the idea of being “symbolic” – the symbol often depends on context: do you look from the Earth perspective, from the cosmic perspective, from day/night, from a day of the week, season, etc… many of ways to interpret things.\r\n\r\nHebrew alphabet is perhaps the only system that equates letters with numbers, there’s no separate numerical alphabet in Hebrew. So one can easily translate any word into a corresponding number using Gematria: the Sun will be 330, the Moon is 170, etc.\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough in English Gematria the Sun in 324, the Moon is 342.\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to see that there are infinitely many ways to play with the numbers, especially the large ones. Is there any magical meaning or application? Some say yes, others disagree. Those who gain a significant insight might want to keep that knowledge hidden due to the nature of public knowledge that dissolves “the edge” or competitive advantage. \r\n\r\nThis isn’t a direct answer to your question, yet I am hoping it’ll shed some light for others who might be curious to learn more about different approaches."
