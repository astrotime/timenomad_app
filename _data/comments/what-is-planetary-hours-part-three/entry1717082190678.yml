message: >-
  Could you explain the difference between the cycle of the planetary hours and
  the cycle of the tattvas (elements) in the Svara tradition, please? From what
  I found out on the internet, the duration of a tattva is 24 min (reflects the
  length of the day), and the starting moment of the svara cycle is the sunrise.
  Which system should be followed, for a better integration of daily
  actions?Thank you.
