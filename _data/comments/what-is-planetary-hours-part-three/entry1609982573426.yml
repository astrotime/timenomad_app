message: "Truly appreciate the thoroughness of this series. There is a lot of depth that you have illustrated from fact and fiction to help us understand this create 1-7 cycle. \r\n\r\nNow my question..\r\nYou've explained why Wednesday comes after Tuesday but why should #TODAY# be named a Tuesday? In other words, when is the starting point for this cycle? I would guess that the answer would follow the same reference point as Tropical Astrology, starting at the Spring equinox"
