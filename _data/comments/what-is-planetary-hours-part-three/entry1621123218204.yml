  Thank you for this fascinating class.....and made me think of the significance
  of the number 7 and the 7 pointed star.  The 51.4285...degrees of the  7
  points of the star within a circle reminds me of the very intentional angle of
  slope of the great pyramid which contains other measurements related to the
  earth.  Something to ponder about their choice of this number.  I do think the
  pyramids created fixed points in the sky which made it easier to see the
  perceived movements of the stars above.   The Lakotas also thought of their
  tipis as funnels for the star energies up above, so the pyramid shape seemed
  to enhance the star energies for many peoples on earth.  You might like the
