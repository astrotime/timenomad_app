message: "Today, I went to the beachfront with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and \r\nsaid \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed the shell to \r\nher ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched \r\nher ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is entirely off topic but I had to tell someone!"
