message: "I have direct NN in Scorpio 11th House (also Pluto retrograde is there) and always in Scorpio 10th House I have Jupiter retrograde...\r\nSo SN in Taurus 5th House with Moon there (and I was born on Monday) (Mars in Taurus but 4th House)\r\n\r\nI am very often focused on the career field because I still don't know what to do in my life and I'm not satisfied with what I'm doing and soon is also coming Saturn return"
