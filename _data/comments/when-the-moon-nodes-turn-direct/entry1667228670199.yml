message: >-
  Thank you so much for this article. It is difficult to find anything on direct
  Nodes, as mine are in my chart, and so many old conversations on the Internet
  just revolve around "its rare, idk anything about it, so it isn't significant,
  move on to the planets."  But the Nodes are SO palpably strong in my life, and
  I have recently noticed that when the transiting nodes go direct, the "veil"
  thins significantly in my life- I have sudden "downloads" of intuitive
  knowledge, I feel an urgency to live this life as sincerely as possible. The
  Nodes are the first things I look at in anyone's chart, and I have noticed
  that some charts just have very strong Nodes- many squares and conjunctions
  and direct vs retrograde.  My own chart's direct nodes (SN conjunct Moon) form
  a Grand Cross with Mercury, Mars, and Neptune. I would say my chart's rulers
  are the Nodes. I know many astrologers would dispute that since they are "just
  points," but as a person who has studied nothing but Nodes for years, I humbly
  disagree.
