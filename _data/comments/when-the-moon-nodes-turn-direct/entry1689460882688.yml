message: >-
  I found Time Nomad about a year ago and it has really helped me dive further
  into my chart, but every time I look at it I feel as if I’m falling deeper
  down the rabbit hole. This article on Nodes is mind blowing and I never
  realised my nodes were direct up to this point, and with multiple conjunctions
  off both NN and SN I feel desperately in need of help in interpreting these. 
  NN is conjunct Pars Fortune, Neptune &  IC in 3rd house Sagittarius. SN is
  conjunct Sun in 9th house Gemini/Taurus. Aspects involved are 1) Thors hammer
  with Saturn and Jupiter with tip on NN 2) NN trine Pluto (1st house Libra) and
  SN trine Mars (7th house Pisces). Also have another Thors hammer with tip on
  Saturn and a kite pattern. Really trying hard to figure out what path I should
  be on but can’t see the wood the trees still. Can anyone help me?
