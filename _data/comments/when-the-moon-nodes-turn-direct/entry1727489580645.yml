  A strong Moon in one's chart would make the person extra sensitive, and that's
  what the Moon archetype is about â€“ feeling more, having deeper intuitions.
  Being conjunct to the North node makes the native more aware of the unfoldment
  of time and the impulses that herald changes even before they have happened.
  Moon is a great friend when it comes to perceiving subtleties!
