message: >-
  hi, )this is 2 years later not sure if you'll see this) I just started looking
  into this as my chart has my moon conjunct my north node which is also direct,
  the opposite of your moon-south node conjunction but having the nodes direct,
  are a significant part of my chart -  T square with my MC opp South Node conj
  Chiron) with moon being my chart ruler i really relate to the nodes being my
  chart rulers as well,and just a coincidence that the nodes are direct as i'm
  typing this i just found out lol but it's hard to find information on direct
  node natal, really useful article and just wanted to add on + appreciate ur
  response ^_^
