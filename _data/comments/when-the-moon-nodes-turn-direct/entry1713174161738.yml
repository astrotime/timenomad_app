  My Nodes are direct. South Node in Taurus in 9th house and naturally my North
  Node is Scorpio in the 3rd House. My moon is also in Scorpio in the 3rd House
  conjunct with Uranus. My Aries Blackmoon Lilith in the 8th House  is conjunct
  Chiron and my South Node. The movie Moana is very meaningful to me. It feels
  as if the Universe is asking me to remember my past lives and waken the
  Goddess inside. My human has no idea what she is doing and yet she is the key
  to bringing the heart back to Te Fiti. I feel strongly a past Male energy that
  abused his power. I have had a hard, not boring, full of fear and anxiety life
  that has been exhilarating, fun, and adventurous. I found my heart.
