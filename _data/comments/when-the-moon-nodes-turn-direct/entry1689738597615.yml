message: "The configuration may be pointing at the Sun that has played a significant role in the past lives –\_shining, giving, spirituality, knowledge. The 9th house is a great place to advance into long terms studies, perhaps with a philosophical angle? The North Node is pointing at Neptune as the direction one move towards, meaning universal values of compassion and expansion. Pluto in the 1st helps to “unstuck” the person’s life trajectory so that their life doesn’t become stagnated in the same patterns. \r\n\r\nTo summarise, it could be the life devoted to expanding one’s knowledge via long term study and research maintaining a certain focus on the philosophical dimension."
