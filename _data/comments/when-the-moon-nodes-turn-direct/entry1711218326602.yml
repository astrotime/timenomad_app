  Wow!  I am only 2 years in to the study of Astrology and I’ve bought most of
  the Nomad’s add-ones.  (I just now got the name - it tickles me!).  In
  addition to TM, I’ve bought an awesome book detailing major transits for me
  the year ahead.  That said, I can”t correlate the day to day transits of
  planetary aspects,  but I can  see an overall theme, but even then, it ties
  out (former CPA/Auditor who appreciates the debt/credit reconciliation
  language in your article) to the Nodes.  I am making this post at 55 years, 10
  months, and 18 days with the NN in Aries host to  Saturn conjunction Chiron at
  18/19 degrees in Natal chart.  One could not stage the dual of the 10th/4th
  house more aptly beginning Feb. 2021 for myself (with the 10th hosting a
  stellum  that took a beating - Mars conjunct Mercury, Algol, Lilith ) and it
  has certainly set the stage for the 9th/3rd house battle as I sit typing with
  a broken finger incurred defending property in the hood (I’ve relocated to) 
  this Pisces new moon while I prepare to file legal matters 3/25 in Court
  against the State who unjustly has taken emminent domain of property. That
  said, although legal matters appear to be the target I aim, I know I will not
  prevail, nor could I have tolerated the amount of pressure I have had I not
  begun to search out the manner or method to re-kindle/unite with the divine. 
  Thank you for your awesome app.   I wished I was more adept at reading it but
  it has been a source of comfort, like security blankly of sorts.  My point,
  the Nodes are pretty blatant reads.  Thanks for the add on.
