message: "You’ve certainly noticed how influential the Nodes are in your chart and that makes a lot of sense experientially. When planets make a lot of aspects to the Nodes the chart hints at a certain dynamics that originated from one’s past lives. It’s a kind of accumulated planetary energies that you would experience strongly in current life. A planet on the South Node suggests that its energies were strong in previous incarnations, both for good and for the opposite. Hence the idea of accumulated karma with a positive or negative balance.\r\n\r\nThe Nodes are one of several windows through which one can access the meaning of the chart. There are charts where the Nodes don’t do much, it others they are very meaningful and influential.\r\n\r\nThe Moon on its South Node shapes how the native perceives the current life – expectations, aspirations, vision, etc. The Moon is very impressionable and takes things deeply, it’s close to one’s skin. Maybe somewhat difficult to deal with the competitive world yet there’s richness in life."
