  Very interesting article!! I was wondering since the time i recently
  discovered my nodes were direct what this truly means and this is the most
  accurate description i found. I have a strong fourth house pluto/mars
  conjunction and uranus at some degrees and many squares to the nodes. My
  attention to the past is always been strong and lately i am on the path to
  uncover many events in the life of my grandmother who lived a troubled life
  and whom i feel so drawn to
