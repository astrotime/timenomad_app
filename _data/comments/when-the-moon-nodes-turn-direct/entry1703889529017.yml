message: "Very interesting article!! I was wondering since the time i recently discovered my nodes were direct what this truly means and this is the most accurate description i have found. I have a strong fourth house pluto/mars conjunction and uranus at some degrees and many squares to the nodes. My attention to the past is always been strong and lately i am on the path to uncover many events in the life of my grandmother who lived a troubled life and whom i feel so drawn to. Never thought though to investigate about my own previous lives but i would start pondering this possibility. Thanks so much for your precious insight, Time Nomad \U0001F64F"
