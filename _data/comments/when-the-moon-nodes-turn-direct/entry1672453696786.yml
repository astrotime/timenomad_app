  I just noticed that I have my nodal structure SN Aries 12H / NN Libra 6H is
  direct.  I had missed this subtle nuance of the Nodes until now; I never knew
  they could be direct.  This article was AMAZING. Thank you.  The details in
  the natal chart really bring out the soul's intention for this lifetime and I
  just loved how you reflected that "subtly" here.  Thank you
