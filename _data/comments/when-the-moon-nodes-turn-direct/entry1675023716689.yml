  The Moon and the South Node in the 5th can offer some clues. The 5th is all
  about creativity, the force that pushes us forward. Given the nodes are
  direct, there could be an invitation to really ponder upon the question of
  “what is my creative input in this life?” Generally the Moon can be sleepy,
  passive and comfort seeking — that’s until one has discovered and activated
  its creative potential. The 5th house has the  pull towards romance &
  procreation, especially with the Moon there it can become the Cosmic Mother
  principle. It depends on what you’re after. But caring and creating are the
  two forces where the Moon is happy to express itself.
