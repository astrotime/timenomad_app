  Thank you for this.  I found the part about direct nodes reversing the Jupiter
  Saturn correlation quite interesting.  The nodes are direct with north node
  conjunct 12th house Virgo Saturn in my chart with Saturn ruling my 4th house
  Capricorn stellium.  That connection to the past makes a lot of sense as I do
  a good amount of ancestor and dream work.
