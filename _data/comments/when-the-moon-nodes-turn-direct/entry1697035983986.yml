  Thanks for the answer. I agree with the Moon can be sleepy, because maybe it
  influences this on my creativity side, I feel I'm not creative at all, I still
  have to find my purpose in life but time goes fast and I feel stucked and
  powerless. I also have Black Lilith Moon in Taurus (4th House) and I don't
  know if this "sleepy" effect is more emphasized...
