  The thing about the lunar nodes is that they make much more sense when real
  planets are conjunct to them. Having an Asc/Mc conjunct to the nodes is also
  an impactful factor. When the nodes are not conjunct with anything it's likely
  that their influence is much more diffused and not so easy to intuit about.
  It's an invitation to look at other planets and their aspects. The real story
  can be unfolding there.
