  The table at the end makes me confused because in traditional astrology, from
  what I've read, it depends on the planetary sect. I read "A Practical Guide to
  Traditional Astrology" by Robert Crane and he said that diurnal planets tend
  to 'prefer' their diurnal signs (So, Jupiter prefers Sagittarius, Saturn
  prefers Capricorn) and that nocturnal planets 'prefer' nocturnal signs (Mars
  for Scorpio, Venus for Taurus). Why did you [or others] discard this idea?
