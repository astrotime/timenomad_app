  This table is actually based on the alternating diurnal/nocturnal distribution
  of signs where Aries is considered diurnal, Taurus nocturnal, Gemini diurnal,
  etc. Then it all falls into orderâ€¦ until Venus that should have Libra as its
  day sign but traditionally considered to have Taurus as the day sign. This
  sort of makes sense experientially. Plus Venus spins in opposite direction to
  other planets. Anyway, go figure!
