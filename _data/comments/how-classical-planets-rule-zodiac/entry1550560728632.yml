message: "I would call it the principle of “dominant polarity”.\r\n\r\nA circle (the unmanifested unity) through the power of manifestation becomes divided and produces a state of duality (day/night, masculine/feminine, left/right, white/black, etc.). This would mean that the circle now has two halves with each of them broadly ruling over some dominant polarity. At the same time, no half is an island, it still encompasses both polarities from within. It’s quite like fractals, you can zoom into them endlessly — movement from broader to deeper preserves the original design.\r\n\r\nEvery woman has a degree of masculinity inside, and every man has a feminine side. The separation of sexes doesn’t draw a hard boundary. Similar with the seasons and the whole of the Zodiac circle. It’s a fascinating topic you’re touching!"
