message: "Taking your good comment into consideration I have updated that part of the article with the goal to further explain why the planets were assigned this way. I have also specified that this article has been written in accordance with the teachings of Ptolemy who lived approximately in years AD 100–170 and considered to be the father of the Western astrological thought. \r\n\r\nThere are certainly other plausible versions and explanations, for example the one that you are referring to, originated by Joseph Crane who is a modern author. It’s really a matter of preference as there are no really hard lines in astrology. Time Nomad blog is based on the classical astrological works that are often centuries old and passed the period of hot debates and a certain equilibrium of consensus has been reached."
