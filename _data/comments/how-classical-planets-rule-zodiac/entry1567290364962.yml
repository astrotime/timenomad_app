  The binary of light and dark is built into the natural design of the
  universe-the values assigned to them are cultural constructs. In patriarchy,
  masculine/physical strength and external activity all associated with light
  and good and valued more...but there are many cultures that have other values,
  and indigenous cultures, people who live close to the earth, feminists l, and
  ecological perspectives tend to see this duality (and the whole spectrum of
  all the shades and tones in between) as all equally valued parts of the whole
  (and of oneâ€™s wholeness). It is tedious and so limiting to constantly see this
  kind of sex-role stereotyping of the universe portrayed as if it is a fixture
  of nature, which it is not! But aside from this filter ...I like your overall
  summary of the structure of reality based on the map of the zodiac !
