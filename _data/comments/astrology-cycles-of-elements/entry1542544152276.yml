  Time Nomad supports both tropical and sidereal zodiac. If you see a star
  symbol anywhere in the app that means that this event is for the sidereal
  zodiac. Use the “Show” menu in the bottom left corner of the screen to select
  which zodiac you want to see. The sidereal zodiac is for those who want to
  align the chart with the movement of the stars, the tropical zodiac aligns
  with the seasons (starting at the vernal equinox). Majority of Western
  astrologers work with the tropical zodiac.
