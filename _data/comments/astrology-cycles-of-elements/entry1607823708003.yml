message: "I'm fascinated by the way planetary returns correspond with typical milestones. \r\nEg Mars return corresponds with the \"terrible twos\" phase that is characterised by fits of rage, temper tantrums etc. \r\nJupiter returns correspond with the maturity and growth that comes around age 12 due to puberty, whilst still maintaining a \"youthful\" joy (unlike the maturity Saturn expects from us during its return around age 29)"
