message: "The angles (Asc/MC) certainly intensify pretty much everything because they are the most time and location specific points of the chart. Positions of planets change rather slowly but the angles move fast and define how the planets distribute across your houses.\r\nCan't see your chart as astro.com expires those images. You better take a screenshot and upload it to something like imgur."
