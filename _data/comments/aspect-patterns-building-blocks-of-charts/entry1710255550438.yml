message: "hi\r\nthank you for your information, I learned a lot from you. ^^\r\nand if you may help I have two questions. \r\n\r\n1\r\nI have 2 T-squares in my birth chart: \r\n1. Saturn opposition Mars and square my Neptun and Neptun square my Mars\r\n2. Saturn opposition moon and square my Asc and moon square my Asc in Cancer\r\n\r\nthe question is: can this be considered as a grand cross?\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n2\r\nI have 2 spikes in my chart\r\n (however, they are like what I saw in my childhood)\r\n\r\n1. Sun BQ my Satun and Chiron (Saturn Q my Chiron)\r\n2. Jupiter 144- Q my Mars and North node\r\n\r\nI wonder if they have a meaning or not.\r\n\r\nwill you help me?"
