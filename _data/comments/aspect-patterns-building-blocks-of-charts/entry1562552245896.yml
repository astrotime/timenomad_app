message: "I have both a fixed grand cross on the axes and a double nodal line aspect like the one in the picture, on which Pluto is sextile my NN and trine my SN and Juno is in the t-square formation. My grand cross includes an exact moon/Mars conjunction at the MC, Uranus close to (in the natal chart) and at the AC (in my current relocation chart) Neptune on the IC and venus at the DC (6th house in natal and right on the DC in relocated chart).  \r\n\r\nI know the grand cross is acting Like a pinball game at times.  I feel as if I am in a rest period now but extreme to the point of isolation.   \r\n\r\nMy natal Uranus is square the transit Uranus which is now right on my moon/Mars conjunction at the MC."
