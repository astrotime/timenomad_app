message: "Hi, I've always been interested in finding out the depths of my birth chart. The more I understand, the more life gets easier. I have been really looking forward for a place where my questions can be answered. \r\nFirst of all I have a Rectangle shape, and I wanted to ask you if there's anything you may know about it. My second question is how Grand Trine with T-Square and Grand Cross combined are affecting my life? Is there anything unusual that I might have overlooked that could help me? \r\nThank you so much for listening me out. I'm amazed by the way there's already so much information in this article. This stuff is really interesting."
