  interesting answer, the truth is that Venus with my pluto affects personal
  relationships to an extreme degree. the chronus conjunction measured at
  144-145 degrees with the pluto he mentioned in the previous post, what could
  it mean????....and something a little more general if someone has 2-3 yod
  boomerangs in these planets does it mean a special "destiny"??? thank you very
  much!!!!!!
