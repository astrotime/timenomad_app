message: "Minor aspects are dormant until one actively moves towards their destiny. That’s perhaps the simplest definition of minor aspects. They sound magical but only come alive in special circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe sense of destiny is something that hints at strong Pluto energies in personal makeup. Destiny isn’t a passive principle, it can’t “come” to a person. The person needs to actively seek it through active experimentation. There got to be skin in the game, otherwise destiny remains an abstract academic concept.\r\n\r\nA good example of destiny would be the Parsifal character from Wagner’s opera with the same name. Reading the libretto gives a good sense of destiny in action."
