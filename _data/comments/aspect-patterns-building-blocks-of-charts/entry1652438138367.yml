  The chart patterns may be captivating and evocative yet the most important
  question is what planets make those patterns? Some patterns may become
  insignificant because of the planets that make them up. In your case the most
  interesting is the Sun-Pluto opposition (ongoing transformation is the way
  forward) and Jupiter-Neptune-Uranus opposition (the generation of fabulous
  babies).
