message: "Thank you for replying. Good to know that it is geographic. But I do Have Jupiter near conjunct but opposite MC which is in Sagittarius - seems an opposition..?\r\n\r\nNow that you mention, Hygeia near conjunct (1 degree apart) MC in Sag and Juno one degree apart in Capricorn to MC sounds like it's all about work..?\r\n\r\nThanks."
