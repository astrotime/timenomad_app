  I have a cluster from 1 libra (jupiter) to 26 Sagittarius (neptune) with all
  my planets in between. Only chiron is opposite my sun (-2째 at 13째 scorpio) at
  15째 taurus, and my nodes at 15째 leo (N) and aquarius (S). You mention the
  benefit of responding irrationally which is shockingly accurate. I also have a
  difficult time with transits, and its constant. I'm interested in purchasing a
  reading if thats something you do. Ive had 7 in a year, and all of them have
  accurately depicted various elements of my personality/past, but none have
  provided me with any actual clarity in dealing with things like transits.
  Honestly I feel both blessed, and tragically broken at the same time. Maybe
  thats my sun square nodes/opposite chiron, but the constant roller coaster
  ride, and a lack of any squares, trines, or oppositions (im all conjunctions,
  and a couple sextiles) creating challenges is quite a lot to process.
