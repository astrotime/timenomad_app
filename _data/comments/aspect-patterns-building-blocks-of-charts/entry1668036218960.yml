  Having Sun-Saturn connected via minor aspects to Pluto could mean a life that
  goes through periods of transformation. Venus-Pluto would be an active force
  that impacts life events and choices while Sun and Saturn will be actively
  challenging that. Venus-Pluto is nice for sex and money but can easily take
  one astray. Yet Venus-Pluto depends on how Saturn impacts them, it can be
  blocking things.
