message: "The 12th house is the house of transformation. That can give you a direction of looking at the transformed (higher) modalities of the planets in that house, especially if they are \"pointed at\" by the yods. \r\n\r\nGenerally, the 12th house invites focus on deepening one's understanding of life and exploring the spiritual dimension of oneself in a quest for ongoing transformation."
