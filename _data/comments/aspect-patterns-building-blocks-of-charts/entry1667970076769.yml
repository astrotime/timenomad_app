  Hello, I would like to ask if anyone has a north link square with venus and
  pluto and venus with pluto in opposition what does this mean based on what you
  mentioned in the article???...and a second question if there is a yod
  boomerang with top of pluto but on the one hand we have 150 and on the other
  hand 144 what does that mean??? (144 between Saturn and pluto, and 150 exact
  degrees between pluto and the sun).
