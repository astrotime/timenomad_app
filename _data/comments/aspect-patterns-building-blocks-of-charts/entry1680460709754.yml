message: "Hi TimeNomad, \r\n\r\nAlmost my whole chart is build on ‘golden yods’. all 5 yods within 3orb. It’s so hard to figure out where to focus bc they’re all over the place. The 12th house is the most shared place. Do you have any suggestions or advice for having so many Yods in general? \r\n\r\nThanks for the read, really enjoyed it."
