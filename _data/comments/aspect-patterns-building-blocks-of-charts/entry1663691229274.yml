message: "Thank you, Time Nomad, for your reply! It is very much appreciated! \r\n\r\nLearning to let go and trust in the process, is definitely something I have been finally realizing of late. It brings with it a sense of freedom but also an uneasiness that comes with change and the unknown.\r\n\r\nThankfully, with the strengthened faith that has come from spiritual growth, I feel more ready for what The Universe has in store.\r\n\r\nThank you again!\r\n\r\n-Peter"
