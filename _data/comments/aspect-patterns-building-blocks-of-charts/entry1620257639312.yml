message: "I’ve had a quick look at your chart and here’s my short thoughts. Generally speaking, Chiron alone isn’t enough to account for spiritual/healing impulse. It may point at what needs to be healed in the person though. On the other hand you have several other much more significant pointers that direct you towards spiritual work. A desire for spiritual work is usually accompanied by a healing desire as well because spiritual is healing in essence.\r\nIn your chart you have some potent pointers that make spiritual work meaningful: Neptune on the South Node in the 2nd house, Sun in the 6th approaching full Moon (that’s an important incarnation for you, especially taking into account their square to the Black Moon), Saturn-Pluto-Moon in 12th is a very interesting cluster, and tight Jupiter-Uranus in the 1st opposite Venus is a potent group for spiritual work. In the nutshell, you have strong major planetary positions and aspects that support your focus on spiritual/healing work."
