  Hey, I don't do much readings these days, simply not enough time! But a quick
  observation would be your Sun square the nodes and opposed to Chiron. This
  really hints at the process of transformation that is ruling your current
  incarnation. Chiron points at the need to heal or simply speaking to embrace
  your Sun. Once you've realised your solar potential that you can meaningfully
  move into the future. But each of us without exception has a specific
  challenge in every incarnation. Yours is about embodying the Sun and accepting
  its incessant drive towards transformation and shining/giving. Your painful
  transits are just that, an opportunity to break out of the self-constructed
  shell. It's your Sun that is working on changing/improving you by challenging
  you. Only makes you stronger, more complete. It's a powerful configuration you
  have. If you take it as a "transform or keep suffering" then things will get
  clearer, you'll get a better perspective and perhaps may even notice the
  moments when it's you fighting against yourself. Embrace impulses from your
  higher self and it'll show the way. But by all means, don't go blind/fanatical
  either, apply your judgement at each step.
