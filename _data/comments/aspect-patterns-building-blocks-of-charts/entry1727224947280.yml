  I'd say use them mildly. The strongest patterns composed of real physical
  bodies (the emitters or reflectors of light). Geometrical points like Asc, MC,
  the Moon nodes and other points like Black Moon would be secondary in terms of
  influence. So yes, they do create patterns but not as impactful as physical
  planets.
