message: "My thinking is along these lines… The kite has a major (opposition) and minor (x2 trines) polarity axes. The envelope has three minor (trine) axes and one major (opposition) axis. First look at the major axis, what kind of planetary forces are involved? What does it mean to have that kind of opposition in your life? Does it create a productive tension or are you getting pulled into different directions?\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve got that understanding, look at other 4 planets that are trine to the the two major ones. Two trines will bring a lot of movement. It may be helpful if the opposition tends to get stuck (like Mars-Saturn, for example). Or the double trine may unsettle what has been working well. All depends on how you handle your planetary energies.\r\n\r\nThe lunar nodes will bring up repeating patterns in your life. Could even be your past lives, if you like that concept. The nodes tend to makes us refer back to what we’ve been doing. We may need to repeat the cycle or may pass the “test” and move on to the next evolutional challenge."
