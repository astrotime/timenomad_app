message: "While this website doesn’t provide readings, I’d focus your attention on the Mars-Moon – Pluto – Sun (T-square). More specifically, the Mars-Moon –\_Pluto axis is something that you need to understand in terms of how it plays out in your life and what kind of conflicts it may bring. You Mars is very strong, and so is your Venus. Lots of drive that can introduce volatility and major shifts. It’s a chart with a punch indeed."
