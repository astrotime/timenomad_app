  And actually I was wrong regarding Pluto and my NNand SN.  Pluto is square to
  both.  Pluto is in the 1st house on Regulus and NNin the 4th and SN in Taurus
  in the 10th.   Opposite Pluto is my Juni, so actually I have two grand
  crosses.  One being Pluto, the nodes, and Juni.  The other being moon/Mars,
  Uranus, Neptune and venus.  Sounds not too easy for love and commitment?  Too
  much fantasy and obsession, no commitment and lots of changes.  Same goes for
  happiness and money
