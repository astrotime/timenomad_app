message: "If the Moon isn't conjunct to Mars then it's probably not a grand cross. The spikes don't look significant as they aren't composed by major planets. The Moon nodes and minor planets don't add much punch to more subtle patterns like the spikes.\r\n\r\nThe Saturn-Mars-Neptune formation is perhaps more important than the other things. There's an invitation to challenge own doubts and procrastination and possibly fears â€” in an active and constructive manner like taking on certain projects that require judgement and discernment and actually completing them."
