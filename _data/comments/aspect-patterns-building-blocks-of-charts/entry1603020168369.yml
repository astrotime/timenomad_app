  This is due to the geographic latitude you were born at, this makes MC
  perpendicular to Asc. I wouldn't treat it as a personal signifier. But I
  agree, this configuration does look impressive. If you have any planets making
  significant aspects to the MC, then look at the influence of those planets as
  they will be extra strong in your chart.
