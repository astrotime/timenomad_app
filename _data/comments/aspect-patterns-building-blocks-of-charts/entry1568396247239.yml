  Thank you.  I did live in NYC for awhile.  I liked it but the noise of traffic
  was highly irritating.  I now live alone and have lots of nature--trees,
  birds, a lake, etc.--right outside my porch, which I live. It is quite
  peaceful.  My moon/Mars conjunction is in Taurus and now has Uranus transiting
  right on them.  Again, they are at the MC in the 10th.   When I am with
  family, I get 9verstimulated by the noise and parties they have.  I like being
  quiet and alone, but I do try to get out with some friends oor at least sit on
  my porch and enjoy the quiet natural setting.
