message: "Wow, Denis, thank you for all that - fascinating.\r\nI must say that you seem to give a lot of information that I haven't seen before, and I appreciate that. Your style is also easily understandable.\r\nAs for the missing illustrations, I have discovered that this happens because my default internet program is Internet Explorer, as it's the only one that allows me to save webpages in .mht format. Firefox works fine, and it does have an option to do something similar now."
