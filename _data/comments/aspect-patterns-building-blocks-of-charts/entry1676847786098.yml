message: "Patterns like the grand cross not only looking impressive, they actually reflect an accumulation of significant astral energies in person’s astral body. Sometimes it works for them, other times against them. The main thing to remember is that once connected by significant aspects those forces are never dormant, they are active and loud.\r\n\r\nThe grand cross you’re describing is the driving force for many situational patterns. Venus, Mars, Neptune, Jupiter dynamics effectively create “push and pull” kind of volatile scenarios where one would oscillate between idealism and fighting. The Moon doesn’t like that kind of stuff and naturally gets hurt.\r\n\r\nShould one shut down their sensitivity and become a fighter? The risk is the loss of the Moon’s fluidity and the power of insight. \r\n\r\nGetting endlessly hurt isn’t a piece of cake but there’s a possibility of staying vulnerable and open while letting things go if needed. And there could be a lot of those “just let it go” moments. When one is easy with letting go, a lot of otherwise aggravating situations won’t even happen. The higher wisdom works wonders."
