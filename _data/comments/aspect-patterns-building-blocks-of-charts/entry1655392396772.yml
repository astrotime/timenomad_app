  Hi again. I was just wondering if you had a view on what a kite combined with
  a T-square could be interpreted as? The ‘tail’ and ‘top’ of the kite are the
  two planets in the T-square that are being squared by the third ‘axis’ planet.
  Jupiter is the axis planet, and the nodes are the other two.
