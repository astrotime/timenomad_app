  There’s plenty of aspect patterns indeed. Not all of them have a significant
  influence – that’s due to the actual planets involved. A good way is to look
  at each aspect in a pattern to see how those energies may interact with each
  other. Patterns as such are hard to be conclusive about, it all depends on the
  ingredients.
