message: "Hi Time Nomad,\r\n\r\nI am looking at my friend's natal chart, and its interesting how her chart consist of mainly Grand Trines, about 7 of them with just a single Square. Is this chart really rare? She's a really good natured person and so far her life as been smooth sailing, I see lots of potential in her 10th house with the earthy clusters and satellitium in virgo, but she's not particularly career focus or ambitious."
