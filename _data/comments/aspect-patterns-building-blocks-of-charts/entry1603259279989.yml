message: "So your Jupiter is conjunct to the IC and opposed to the MC - the second major axis of the chart. This gives an extra strength to Jupiter, it has more influence in your chart. It's certainly a great position, Jupiter brings a good degree of popularity, luck, protection from the powerful people, etc. A lucky planet indeed!\r\n\r\nThe asteroids on the MC may add some tints but won't have any significant influence in comparison to Jupiter, they are too tiny."
