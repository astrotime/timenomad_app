message: "Yes, you’re making a valid point about **Adolf Hitler’s chart**. He had two spike formations. A **biquintile spike**, recently popularised as a “golden yod” wasn’t so “golden” in Hitler’s case. That’s why I am hesitant to use this superlative term because it equally applies to forces of good and evil. Since traditionally gold is the symbol of integrity, we are clearly getting a contradiction here: Hitler was anything but a person of integrity. His biquintile spike points at Moon–Jupiter, a fantastic combination for dealing with crowds, the skill that Hitler was a magician of.\r\n\r\nAnother is a **sesquisquare spike** clearly pointing at significant karma with one of its base ends resting on the South Node and another on Uranus. This karmic spike points at Neptune–Pluto conjunction. And this makes a lot of sense since the discovery of Pluto pretty much coincided with the new era of world wars.\r\n\r\nBelow are Hitler’s natal charts. The chart of major aspects doesn’t disclose much about his real abilities apart from his very strong libido that was equally strongly repressed, a common scenario for dark force initiates.
