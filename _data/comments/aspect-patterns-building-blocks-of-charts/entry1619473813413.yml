message: "Hello Mr. Nomad! I was curious if you had some thoughts on my kite and spike patterns in my chart. I feel like they've really pulled me towards my spiritual/healing work but I have been mystified by the lack of information that I can find on them. Seeing Chiron at the Apex of my Yod seems to have made the healing part of my life a whole life long process. \r\n\r\nIf you could give me any insight I would greatly appreciate it. My dob is 4/26/1983 9:20 p.m. Kansas City Missouri."
