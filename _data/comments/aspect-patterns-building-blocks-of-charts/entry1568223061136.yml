message: "Is it only planets that “count” for aspect patterns? \r\nWhen looking at my chart, it is almost exactly like the photo posted under “What intensifies aspect patterns” however mine has Pluto/South Node on the ascendant, Jupiter/Part Of Fortune on the IC, Lilith/North Node on the Descendant, and Mars/Mercury on the Midheaven."
