  I came across this article and comparing my chart to the pictures above mine
  is way different I have 5 planets in my 5th house  2 in my 6th house and 2 in
  my 4th house. I'm trying to understand my chart better to understand myself
  better. I am open to hearing anyone help with some insight  Bday is 09/01/1980
