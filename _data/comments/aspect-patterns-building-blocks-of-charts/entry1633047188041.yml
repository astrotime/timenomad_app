  One can look at the values embodied by a specific pair of houses in the light
  of the aspect. For example, 4th is about the roots of personality, childhood,
  etc. The 10th is professional area, doing in the world. Those two houses are
  opposed to each other. If one has planets in both that are square to another
  planet, for example in the 7th then look how the planet in question creatively
  challenges (square) planets in the houses. This would alter the feel of each
  house.
