message: "Hi, \r\nI'm just a novice to the Astrology with a few days of learning :3\r\nI do appreciate your article, especially your effort. I would like to ask you some aspects in my natal chart because I found some major aspects and some aspects which are not in your chart.  (i.e,  Cradle & Multiple Planets Opposition)\r\n*I'm not interested in Astrology before. But, after facing some unexpected things, I'm deeply focused to analyze myself and my life, I'm in touch with astrology unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nWith the help of it, I found some answers for my lifetime paradoxes.\r\nMeanwhile, my mind is calm, ready to accept unexpected and (I think) I know more about myself (because I feel like ahh, I have a clearer view about myself – strengths, weaknesses, merits, demerits etc.*\r\n\r\nIt's a little strange that the more I know about myself and accept the things as parts of mine, my mind is calmer. When I prepare to face my fear and anxiety, I feel like I'm not afraid as much before. \r\n\r\nThat's some of my experiences after learning some psychological and philosophical concepts from astrology.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd like to know some important facts about my natal aspect patterns.\r\nI'm really grateful if you point out a little (only if you have some extra times). Here are the aspects of my natal chart -\r\n\r\n#1 Stellium\r\n#2 (Fire)Grand Trine\r\n#1 Kite\r\n#1 Grand Cross-Aligned with the Four Angles (?)NN0°-TN29°-Moon2°(?)\r\n#1 T-Square \r\n#1 Cradle \r\n#1 Multiple Planet Opposition\r\n\r\nAnyway, thank you very much for the resourceful article Sir. \r\nWishing all the best to you \U0001F64F\U0001F60A"
