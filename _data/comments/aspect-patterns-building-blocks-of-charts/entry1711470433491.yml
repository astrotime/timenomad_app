message: "Mystic rectangle wasnt covered here but I have a question - in my chart, I have MC at 20 Libra, Vertex & south node at 21 & 19 Leo, IC at 20 Aries, and Moon & north node at 19 Aquarius. Since I am using my MC IC and nodal axes, does this still count? alternatively it can be MC, Vertex, IC and Moon... I'm not sure what can and cant be used... if we then incorporate major asteroids and so forth all the patterns will emerge! \r\nAlso, I have sun 12 sag, and moon 19 Aquarius both 66 apart and at 147 to Chiron in cancer - this is a yod/ spike right? since its a biquintile with 3 orb"
