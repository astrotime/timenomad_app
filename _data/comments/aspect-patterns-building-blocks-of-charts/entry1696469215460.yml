message: "Astrological aspect patterns constitute what is referred as \"chapters\" within one's personality. The way to look at them is to write down each planet of the pattern and see how the planetary forces may interact with each other. Ignore the Moon nodes, they aren't exactly celestial bodies, that may simplify understanding. It's fine to add the nodes later but that would be counterproductive in the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe geometry of the pattern will give you and idea how those planetary energies relate to one another. You can lookup the qualities of aspects (conjunction, opposition, square, etc) to get basic ideas."
