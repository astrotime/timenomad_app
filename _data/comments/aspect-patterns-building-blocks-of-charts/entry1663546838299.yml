message: "I think your chart genuinely points at a series of changes, perhaps sudden and unexpected to you but they all make sense from the spiritual transformation standpoint. This is your Sun-Uranus opposed to Mars.\r\n\r\nThere may be certain resistance from your side due to Saturn-Pluto square. Just learning to let go and readjust is an important attitude for a chart like yours.\r\n\r\nYour yods also point at Saturn and Mars reinforcing those points."
