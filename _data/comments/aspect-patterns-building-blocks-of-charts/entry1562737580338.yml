message: "Have been thinking about your chart. The grand cross aside, the Moon–Mars conjunction is the aspect to focus on as the rest of the chart can become much more workable once Moon–Mars is happier.\r\n\r\n**Moon–Mars conjunction is always a challenge** until the native figures out its potential. Their Moon is fiery and can experience burning passion and imagination. On the downside, Mars makes Moon restless. It’s important to find peace without forgetting about the need for engagement — tricky to satisfy the both! A practical approach can be regularly spending a good amount of time walking in nature and feeling the surrounding energies: forests with big trees supply good emotional grounding to the Moon and also feed Mars with the dynamic energy of life. Life in an urban environment is likely to aggravate neurosis in Moon-Mars people. Nature can alleviate the symptoms and even heal."
