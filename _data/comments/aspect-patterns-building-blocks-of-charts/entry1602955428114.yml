message: "# Love it!\r\n_it's just..._ look I'll be blunt, take it or leave it - the tone could do away with speaking *\"matter-of-factly\"*. It makes it impalpable to us who treat it as a science and even when things are said nonchalantly, should be given reference to prove the case in point. Otherwise in science you have doctors going around thinking that vaccines have never killed people or caused human harm. Which is grotesquely false and as easily verified as false as seeking to read the published science papers themselves.\r\n\r\nWe must respect the rule of thumb -all things true lead to source.\r\nAs else which aim us away from source tend to falsify or elaborate, or insert suggestive storyline which the author believes to be true due to lacking of data and filling in the gaps with that which makes sense to him or her.\r\n\r\nIntention may be well - but the results sometimes are catastrophic."
