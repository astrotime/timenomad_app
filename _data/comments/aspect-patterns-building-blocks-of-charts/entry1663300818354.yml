message: "Greetings Time Nomad!\r\n\r\nI have recently been informed of three “yods,” aka spikes, occurring in my natal chart. It was so difficult for me to find interpretations for them together as they form a pentagram. The pentagram, however, is an imperfect pentagram and I am wondering what your thoughts would be on such. It definitely stands out very clearly in my chart and involves major planets with very close orbs. \r\n\r\nThe past year for me has been both transcendental and overwhelming with a heavy amount of opposing positive/negative events. The discovery of this irregular pentagram is in-line with the spiritual transformation I’ve been going through.\r\n\r\n20 Oct 1973 01:25am Plainfield, NJ USA\r\n\r\nThe pentagram has, at the point, Neptune in 5° Sagittarius 4th house, sextile, on either side, to Pluto at 5° Libra 2nd house and Jupiter at 3° Aquarius 6th house. At the base of the irregular pentagram are, two planets that square the top two side points and sextile each other, Saturn at 4° Cancer 11th house and Mars at 3° Taurus 9th house.\r\n\r\nIn total the configuration contains 3 sextiles (Saturn/Mars, Pluto/Neptune, Jupiter/Neptune), 2 squares (Saturn/Pluto, MarsJupiter) and 1 trine (Jupiter/Pluto).\r\n\r\nI feel like this pentagram, and my just now discovering its occurrence in my chart, is integral to the beautifully positive and light filled spiritual path which I had no idea that my entire life was leading towards (until the personal and worldwide events of this past year), the magnified connection to the collective consciousness which has become very direct for me at times, the role of guide and advisor that has always existed in my life with personal one-on-one instances, but which has quickly been taking on a significantly larger scope of influence these past 13 months, and my complete shutdown at one point due to the overwhelming nature of it all. \r\n\r\nThe significance of my interactions with many individuals regarding their own spiritual awakenings, since my personal experiences approx a year ago, and their heartfelt gratitude that was expressed when I validated their experiences with my own, at first was intriguing, then becoming overwhelming but now something I feel I am being called to accept as my journey towards my “purpose” in this lifetime.\r\n\r\nWHEW, I know that’s a whole lot to take in, boy do I know it, LOL, but I am truly in search of some outside interpretation regarding this pentagram and how it could be relating to everything I’ve been experiencing of late that has been slowly building my entire life starting with the passing of my father when I was only 12. He was heavily involved in many aspects of magic and astrology and had promised to teach me but passed before doing so, which set me on a path that is coming to fruition as my Chiron return approaches. \r\n\r\nOk, I’m done rambling, I promise. \r\n\r\nWith truest gratitude,\r\n\r\n-Peter"
