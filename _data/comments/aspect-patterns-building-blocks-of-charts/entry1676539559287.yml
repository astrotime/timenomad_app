message: "Absolutely love that I came across this page. I have quite a few aspect patterns…a cardinal grand cross, 2 yods, a kite (with grand trine), a castle. My yods connect my castle to the grand cross. I have been trying to track transits to the apex of my yod but still struggling to understand it. \r\n\r\nMy yod is my Moon (2nd house) sextile my Ascendant (conjunct north node) both inconjunct to my Mars in the 7H (which is in my grand cross). \r\n\r\nFor the last year I’ve been having transit Uranus forming a yod…it’s sextile my Mars and forms an inconjunction/apex to my NN/Asc. It’s been an intense year. \r\n\r\nLately though, I’m very fascinated by how synastry charts activate our patterns. I recently met a love interest and we activate each others yods. The apex’s of our yods sextile each other…forming some kind of a reverse yod on my NN/Asc (and his Mars), which feeds into a grand trine, and also sextiles other planets. \r\n\r\nTo better explain…\r\n\r\n16 degrees Sag - my nn, my asc, his mars\r\n14 degrees Aqua - my moon, his Uranus \r\n18 degrees Libra/11 degrees libra - his mercury/my Jupiter\r\n\r\n16 degrees Taurus - his Saturn\r\n14 degrees cancer - my mars\r\n\r\n18 degrees Aries - my Venus\r\n20 degrees Leo - his Venus, my chiron\r\n\r\nSo I have a grand trine with my nn/asc, Venus, chiron and his Mars and Venus join that. And it’s added by the sextiles and forms 3 yods bouncing off each other. \r\n\r\nI have no idea what it all means…or how it will manifest. But I found the intersections of our aspect patterns very curious and hope to understand it. Is there even a shape for something like this? 2 sextiles pointed at an apex planet that forms a grand trine and inconjuncts 2 planets that also sextile each other and inconjunct the other sextile? Haha. (Apex planet here being my Asc/NN in first house conjunct his Mars in 10th or 11th house. I only know he’s an Aquarius ascendant but not the degree to determine which house his Mars falls into. But I have a feeling given this points to my NN in 1st house that this one isn’t gonna end in a relationship even though it’s significant….to be determined!)\r\n\r\nPs…no idea how to work with my own aspect patterns. Yod on my Mars in 7H inconjunct my NN and Moon and mars as part of the grand cross is kind of a mess. I basically keep having major conflicts with people to force me to stand up for myself and all i want is friends and yet every time I make them I’m forced to battle them and stick up for myself. My friends and lovers always become open enemies. Like seriously I think I’m being a loving cancer and next thing I know I can’t go out in public because they’re screaming swear words at me. It’s not fun haha. Before I discovered astrology I kept thinking I was doing something really wrong and that the solution was to make myself small and quiet and agreeable. But the fact I keep getting fed clear moments where I have to defend myself, people being very cruel, it just makes me think that being quiet and agreeable isn’t working. My discovery of my NN in 1st house, and a yod on my Mars in my 7th makes me wonder if the path to healing is actually to step into these battles and choose myself over keeping harmony. But my chart ruler is Jupiter in libra….so that’s really hard to accept. Ah the grand cross. Didn’t even get into that… Venus square Neptune and mars, Mars square jupiter opposite Neptune, jupiter opposite Venus. \r\n\r\nTo all us grand cross folks…thinking of you. Hopefully we can all help each other find our way."
