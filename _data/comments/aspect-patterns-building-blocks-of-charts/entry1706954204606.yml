message: "That's the thing with the trines — they are good for the flow but not good at manifesting things in the physical world. To be ambitious and creative one needs squares, oppositions and a bit of conjunctions. And a good placement of Saturn — it's hard to do things without Saturn that works as opposed to blocking the flow.\r\n\r\nBut the trines are good for activities that involve holding and nurturing people. It can be things like counselling, psychology, etc. — the caring aspect"
