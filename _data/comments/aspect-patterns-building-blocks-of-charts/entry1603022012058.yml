message: "I describe astrology as a “discipline” and a “symbolic language” thus steering away from the category of science. In science we measure and count something that has hard evidence and can be proven and ideally 100% repeatable. Astrology is way more fluid and doesn‘t follow the hard rules of logic.\r\n\r\nThis article is a personal reflection on the meaning of aspects as described through the lens of personal empirical observation and deduction of truthfulness or falseness of certain assertions. It‘s about how I as the author experience the phenomena of the aspects."
