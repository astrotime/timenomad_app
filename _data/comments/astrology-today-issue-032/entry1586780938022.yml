  I am astonished at how much your app does! I learned how to cast a chart,
  using an ephemeris & log tables, in 1968. Your app does more than I ever
  could, Brian. And it replaces my (now discontinued) astrology software, on my
  Mac. Iâ€™ve upgraded everything but the added minor planets/asteroids. Keep up
  the excellent work.
