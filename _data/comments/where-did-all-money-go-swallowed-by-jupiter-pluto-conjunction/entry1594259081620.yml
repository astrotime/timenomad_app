  Yes, mess and deception are Neptunian side effects. Neptune can bring about
  massive delusions, especially when enforced by some other planets. And that's
  I think the problem with America as the current dominant economic force, it
  doesn't have a good grasp of Neptunian values, hence all the twists that we're
  witnessing.
