message: "Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies do hold a promise indeed. They certainly are future oriented in their appeal (open standards), technology based and offer transactional transparency. Yet, it’s a very early stage for crypocurrencies and a lot of excessively optimistic people will get burn trying to get into the game. Somewhat similar to the Robinhood traders who are excessively optimistic but may lack deeper understanding of the foundations of how real economy and financial economy work. Crypto and online trading always come with a catch — too easy to push a button, hence their addictive nature. That’s something I take with extreme caution.\r\n\r\nWe shall see how cryptocurrencies unfold and who will be unavoidable losers and winners. Fundamentals like gold and silver are likely to remain fundamentals because no one can “hack” the amount of gold on the planet (that is until asteroid mining develops). Yet there’s always a risk that the blockchain integrity may get disrupted in a number of ways that we’re unaware of yet, just like we were unaware of coronavirus. This world is full of wonderful surprises, isn’t it?"
