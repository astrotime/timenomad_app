  Considering that we are in a full-blown spiritual war, the only way to fix
  this economic mess is to return to the gold standard. Gold represents the
  Alpha energies (and Christ consciousness) and silver represents the Omega
  energies. Since the passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 we have been
  living under a fiat currency and economic slavery, which is worldwide. If we
  don't eliminate the Fed and international central banks and their
  manipulations of everything, there will not be freedom anywhere. You cannot
  have real, true freedom without economic independence from the fallen angels.
