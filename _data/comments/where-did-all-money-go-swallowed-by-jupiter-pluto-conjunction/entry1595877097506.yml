message: "I’m here to say give crypto a chance!\r\n\r\nBitcoin is such a beautiful expression of many planetary energies and it was developed precisely in response to the 2008 crisis: \r\n1) the Saturnian energy of a defined beginning and ending as it’s algorithmically limited to 21 million coins. \r\n2) Blockchain in general is the epitome of Mercurial energy, of the efficient flow of information, the foundation of trade. Also the trickster spirit of the nouveau rich cypherpunks and crypto traders \r\n3) the Jupiter energy of expanding good fortune through mass adoption. For many crypto is a political and philosophical movement to expand access to financial services for millions who have been excluded. If you’ve never had a bank account, you would be able to leapfrog into a crypto wallet. \r\n4) Bitcoiners unconsciously invoke the moon with a lot of their slang, and I think there’s some Lunar power underfoot :)\r\n\r\nI could go on! I really think this technology is a spiritual tool that is changing the world."
