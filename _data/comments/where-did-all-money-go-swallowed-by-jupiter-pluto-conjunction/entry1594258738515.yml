message: "My perception is that in the future much of our lives will be nearly entirely “documented” by digital systems that we use, there’s really no other way around that — once we do something in the digital world, we leave a trace, a record is automatically created. From this standpoint it is very likely that most of our lives will be thoroughly “logged”. We will eventually get used to that, generation after generation. \r\n\r\nMonetary transactions will certainly have personal electronic “thumbprints” all over them: from whom, to whom, time, place, reason, etc. This could have positive effect on the overall economy as those streams can be optimised, analysed and improved. Future societies may be able to be leaner and much more stable — that’s obviously provided that governments won’t be corrupt. \r\n\r\nThere is some degree of hope that having personal cryptocurrency fully transparent may help preventing (or fighting) government corruption. Thant’s a good outcome. At the end of the day, most of crises come from natural degradation of the ruling elites. Slowing down that degradation can bring net positive outcome for the whole of society.\r\n\r\nAnd taxation is guaranteed to be much much easier or even fully automatic, no time wasted doing taxes! Accountants will suffer though."
