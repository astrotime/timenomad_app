message: "Manipulations is the keyword here. Self-inflicted lack of transparency that the governments suffer so much from. Things can be and should be simpler. It looks like deep inside most of politicians just don’t know what to do, they are lost due to complexity of the situation, so all they can do is keep patching up hoping that “it won’t happen during my term”. The curious downside of democracy is that politicians have no skin in the game, it’s nearly always win-win for them. \r\n\r\nOn the esoteric side, Gold–Silver is the Sun–Moon balance of energies, the force that holds the planet together and allows life. Live long and prosper."
