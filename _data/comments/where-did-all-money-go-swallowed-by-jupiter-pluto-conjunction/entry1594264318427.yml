message: "Interesting that the notion of magic (that the book touches) will not disappear in the future but will move from “crows, runes and omens” to digital and numerical magic, there will be digital number crunching magic at levels we’re currently not aware of, that will produce some serious results. The 21st century is the period of transition from old atavistic type of magic to magic 2.0 so to speak — that’s truly exciting times to notice the shift and start learning new forms of magic.\r\n\r\nFrom the esoteric perspective, the previous generation of beings (that were backing nature, culture, rituals, etc) on which the old classical magic rested have pretty much completed their departure from the world scene around 1970-80s, hence the current breakdown of “old” ways and methods, including much of magical lore that was with us for many a centuries. \r\n\r\nIt’s the time for new and truly exciting things to emerge."
