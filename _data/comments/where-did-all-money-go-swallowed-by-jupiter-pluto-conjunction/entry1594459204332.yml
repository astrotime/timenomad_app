  Born at 19 deg Capricorn, Ive had the Pluto, Saturn, Jupiter dance right over
  my head since 2008.  Then we lost all our money and I found myself supporting
  a family of 3, job to job and carrying  a 70 debt. Last year, I amassed some
  money but without employment, it went. Lucky to.have a job now, but my take on
  personal money management has changed forever.  I personally lived these
  astrological influences, to the core!  Not easy.
