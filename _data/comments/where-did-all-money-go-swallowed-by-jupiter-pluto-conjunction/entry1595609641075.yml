  Thank you for this great article. Above all, your vivid connection of
  historical and current relationships. But finally I had to smile at this
  sentence: "Yet long-term pursue of the model of unlimited growth is hardly a
  viable strategy here on Earth with its inherently limited resource pool",
  because right now and precisely to the Jupiter / Plutoconjunction some states
  want to escape this earthly scarcity. The many Mars exploration missions these
  days are already trying to escape this earthly shortage and look for resources
  on the next planet.
