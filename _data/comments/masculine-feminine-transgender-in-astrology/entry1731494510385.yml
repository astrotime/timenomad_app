message: "Not sure which gender you are so frustrated with, I couldn't find in the article the gender you mentioned. Also, historical references are clearly indicated in the article, there's no need to be offended.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the angels and their genders it's a big question indeed. It's funny to think that St Michael has a penis. And after all, who has seen him? Of course we are very happy to quote things... but have we really seen angels with our own eyes? That's a big fat if.\r\n\r\nIt's always better to keep things light and steer away from dogma and religious fundamentalism. Making jokes is always supreme to being angry."
