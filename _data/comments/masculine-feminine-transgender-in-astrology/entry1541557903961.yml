message: "Certainly agree with your point. The notions of transgender is somehow more relevant or better understood by the modern society, hence my  choice to use it in the article. I have made some edits to bring extra fluidity to the gender definitions in the story, thank you for the feedback! An  interesting observation of what is also being considered as “transgender” according Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n> … it may include people who are not exclusively masculine or feminine (people who are genderqueer or non-binary, including bigender, pangender, genderfluid, or agender). Other definitions of transgender also include people who belong to a third gender, or else conceptualize transgender people as a third gender.\r\n\r\nLots of options!"
