message: "A while ago a friend asked me if I could read  a chart without knowing the gender of the individual. I told him that there were planets that dealt with certain “functionings” that made that irrelevant, such as the Moon’s relationship to the birth cycle. He was hung up with an ideology that said there should be no difference, therefore astrology was limited in its scope. \r\n\r\nBack to Jupiter: It is exalted in Cancer! But with Saturn, Chronus to the Greeks, who was a destroyer, why should that negativity be the province of male principle, even though he castrate his father, Uranus - whose other name was Kaos (hmm...Saturn = order, castrated Kaos) I think that female and male principles should be applied to male and females alike, and nature will provide for equality and balance.\r\n\r\nI wrote an article, Intersteller Solar/Lunad Dynamics, asking how should planets that have more than one Moon and at varying sizes be regarded. We have a unique relationship between our “Two Lights,” in that they are approximately the same size, creating a Yin-Yang balance in our nature. But what about planets where the Moons will be larger, and in some cases numerous. How would charts for individuals be done on those planets. We don’t have to go out of our solar system to observe that! My article: http://thenewtimesholler.com/ARCHIVE/inteluna.html"
