message: "There are planetary pairs in astrology that display a certain polarity in terms of symbolism. This effect is known as the dialectic. Such two planets's qualities are mutually complimentary. Similar to the yin-yang principle. \r\n\r\nSome examples of dialectic pairs: Sun-Moon, Mars-Venus, Jupiter-Mars, Jupiter-Saturn, Moon-Saturn, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Sun is traditionally perceived more \"male\" than the Moon that symbolises the reflective\_\"female\" side of duality. Sun radiates, Moon reflects. Sun is the impulse of life, Moon is the womb, etc."
