  Your previous article called Mercury "androgynous", which seems perfect.
  â€œTransgender" implies rejection of birth gender in favor of the opposite
  binary, not ambiguity. There is "pangender" for expression of all
  possibilities, "bi-gender" for switching between polarities, "neutrois" for
  indifference to polarities...  But androgynous has infinitely more history and
  recognition than any of those.
