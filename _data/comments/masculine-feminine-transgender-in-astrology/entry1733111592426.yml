  I agree that transgender isn't an accurate description of Mercury as a
  historical term. However when you study astrology you learn the masculine and
  feminine significations of planets (that have been taught for hundreds if not
  thousands of years) and Mercury is neither masculine nor feminine in its
  expression. "Gender neutral" was the word my teacher used. It is simply not
  accurate to say that every planet is either masculine or feminine.
