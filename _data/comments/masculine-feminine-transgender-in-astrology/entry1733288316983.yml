message: "The transgender word. The prefix \"trans-\" simply means \"across\", that's the standard dictionary definition. For example, \"transatlantic voyage\". Saying that Mercury operates across the gender divide makes perfect sense.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there is duality in everything. Yin-yang, male-female, dark-light, hot-cold, etc. Astrology is the domain of symbolism. Symbolic language allows for greater flexibility compared to, for example, an accounting parlance. \r\n\r\nMercury transcends the principle of polarity and duality which can be described in many ways – male/female, new/old, active/passive, close/far, positive/negative, hot/cold... \r\n\r\nThe male-female (masculine/feminine) principle – not in the meaning of \"biological gender\" – was traditionally used in all things cosmology related for many centuries. It's a convenient abstraction that allows to speak of many things of fluid nature."
