message: "Please stop spreading these lies about netjeru gender.  It is very insulting and infuriating. There are male and female energies which were assigned at the beginning of time and were clearly the traditional descriptions. They are not androgynous as angels and some humans are believed to be, however, there are also separate male and female angels assigned male and female energies of those particular genders according to their duties.\r\nSaint Michael, for instance, is male as the name is obviously male.  He wields a sword and shield as male warriors of early times did.  He was assigned to handle the traditional male role. Females of ancient times generally would not have even been capable of lifting a sword with both hands let alone one.  \r\nClearly, you have not studied history nor are you qualified in any way to spread this nonsense. People of ancient times would never have even used any term closely related to \"transgender\". Instead, there were known to have been hermaphrodites.  Those individuals who possessed both sexual organs and were extremely rare and rare today."
