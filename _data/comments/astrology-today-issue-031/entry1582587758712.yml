message: "All good points. I’ve been wondering about astrology of the coronavirus outbreak. \r\nIt’s clearly something out of ordinary (although not much unexpected). \r\n\r\nAnother good pointer is the dimming of Betelgeuse star which since about October 2019 dimmed down to only about 36 percent its normal brightness. For a few months I’ve been wondering if my eyes don’t see the right way until I’ve read about this phenomenon.\r\n\r\n![Fixed star Betelgeuse before and after dimming, 2019](/images/photos/star-betelgeuse-before-and-after-dimming-2019.jpg)\r\n\r\nBetelgeuse is of Mars–Mercury nature with some Jupiter touch. It’s good for grounding wealth and gives success to military campaigns. Its detriment it can signify fevers and acute diseases… coronavirus have certainly emerged during its demise.\r\n\r\nBetelgeuse is truly important astral energy when it comes to grounding human soul into the body, strengthening the immune system and providing robustness of health.\r\n\r\nJust a few hours ago, on the February 25, some scientists have reported that the dimming has stopped. The original impulse and its influence are still here."
