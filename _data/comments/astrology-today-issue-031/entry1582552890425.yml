  Awesome article brother. Really appreciate your knowledge and have learned a
  lot from you.  As far as the Corona Virus, I see it as a cleanse (no such
  thing as a virus).  Etymology of the word "virus" is releasing venom from the
  snake (kundalini).  I did not look at my transit chart to warn me about a big
  cleanse I'm going through.  Hygiea in Taurus opposite my natal hygiea and just
  coming out of aspect of Uranus and Eris Feb 21st.  I know that with the
  weather predictions I'm doing (internal and external) when Eris (madonna,
  isis, Santa-claustrum, la Befana, ma'am, etc) comes out of an aspect it's like
  the releasing of pulling apart two magnets.  Your hands fly apart one
  released.   Uranus is in a bi-quintile with my Natal Hygiea.  I wonder how
  many people with the cleanse of the Corona have hygiea involved.  Peace and
  Cheers!
