  I dont think lunars nodes work in real life. My english is weak, but i'm
  trying to explain. Lunars node comes from vedic astrology, and the adaptation
  to western system was senseless. The fact is that in western system you have
  to be the opposite of what you are to get rid of karma, but this is
  impossible, maybe the hardest thing someone can do. On vedic the person is
  already rahu oriented,dont need to change any thing. For some years i tried to
  put the aries north node in practice(that is in conjunction with my aries
  rising), never worked, everytime i acted to be more independent and selfish, i
  suffered more and more bad consequences, the world dont tolerate this kind of
  atitude, people who run society want conformism and herd mentality. It was
  even bad to my mental health to follow this thing of lunars node. But in vedic
  system makes sense to me to have rahu in pisces in conjunct with the pisces
  rising(of vedic system). Sorry the poor english, but, i hope you understand.
  Lunars node are senseless, people should not think about it. I am a male, just
  like to use nickname of blackmoon.
