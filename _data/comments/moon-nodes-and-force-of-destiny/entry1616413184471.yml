message: "The nodes in signs & houses still give only generic information. Always see if there are any aspects involved (squares and trines in your case). The North Node in the Leo/7th may point at the process of affirmative self-development in the areas of relationships, both personal and work wise. Or possible challenges if those areas approached with an excessively pushy attitude. Ponder on those situations as they would give you a lot of information about yourself.\r\nHaving the South Node in the 1st is an important position that usually points at \"who was I in the past\", many of today's tendencies stem right out of that. A topic for a focused self-exploration."
