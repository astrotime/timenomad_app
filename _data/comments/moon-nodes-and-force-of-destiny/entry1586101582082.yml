  Download the article: The Effect of Lunar Nodes on Human Biography: Our Hidden
  Plan by Susanne Donato In a lecture in Dornach, Switzerland, on April 16,
  1920, Rudolf Steiner explained how the macrocosmic breathing process in the
  heavens is connected to the microcosmic breathing process in the human world
  and comes to expression through a rhythmic time cycle of 18.6 years. In human
  biography, we find this rhythmic cycle in the lunar nodes rhythm or moon
  nodes. According to Steiner, important things are happening with the human
  soul at these points in time.
