message: "A very excellent article with an interesting historic perspective and very fitting interpretation of aspects to the Nodes. Great insight into the Venus square the Nodes as I happen to have it with a 1ยบ orb. This aspect has such significance and impact in my chart that I've been studying it for a long time and still open to widening my understanding of its meaning, both as a standalone influence and as it blends with the energies of the overall chart. \r\n\r\nGreat site and look forward to coming back to read more of your articles. Keep up the great work!"
