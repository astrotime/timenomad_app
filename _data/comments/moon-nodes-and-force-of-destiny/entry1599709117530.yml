  The devil turned into a dragon. The nodes are an energy that does not know
  right from wrong, a energy (rahu ketu) that makes "a whole lot of nothing"
  (read the Mahabharata). It will use every trick in the book to try to deceive
  you and otheres into getting you all the stuff of the house its in. The north
  south energy cancles its self out because you cant have more of one without
  the other. I know it sounds wonderful but its just not. I have a saturn trine
  to my nn and im a capricorn.
