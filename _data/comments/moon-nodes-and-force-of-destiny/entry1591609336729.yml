message: "TRIFECTA! A novel that starches your emotional – erotic itch!\r\nAgainst a background of big business, deceit, frustration, oppression drives a wide range of emotions as three generations of women from the same family, turn to the same man for emotional support and physical gratification!\r\nA wife deceives her husband while searching for her true sexuality!\r\nWhat motivates the wife’s mother and son-in-law to enter into a relationship?\r\nThe wife’s collage age daughter, with tender guidance from her step-father, achieves fulfillment!\r\nDoes this describe a dysfunctional family? Or is this unspoken social issues of modern society?\r\nBLOCKBUSTER Opening! A foursome of two pair of lesbians playing golf. A little hanky – panky, while searching for a lost ball out of bounds. Trifecta has more turns and twist than our intestines.\r\nTrifecta! Combination of my personal experiences and creativity.\r\nhttps://bit.ly/www-popejim-com for “CLICK & VIEW” VIDEO. Send me your commits.\r\nAvailable amazon, book retailers.\r\nTrifecta! by James Pope"
