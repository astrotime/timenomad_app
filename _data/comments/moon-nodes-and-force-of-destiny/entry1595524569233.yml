  Good afternoon, I was just visiting your site and filled out your feedback
  form. The feedback page on your site sends you these messages via email which
  is why you're reading through my message right now right? This is half the
  battle with any kind of online ad, making people actually READ your message
  and that's exactly what I just accomplished with you! If you have something
  you would like to blast out to millions of websites via their contact forms in
  the U.S. or to any country worldwide send me a quick note now, I can even
  target particular niches and my costs are very low. Send a message to:
