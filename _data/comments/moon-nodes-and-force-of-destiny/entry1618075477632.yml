message: "Wonderful article on nodes. Very informative and well explained. I have too many aspects to my nodes so wonder which one will be considered most important. I have NN in Aries in 2nd house and SN in Libra in 8th conjunct Pluto(by 4 degrees) in Scorpio. My nodes have a tight square to Venus and not so tight square to Mars. So basically planets ruling both Aries and Libra are square my nodes!\r\n\r\nThen I have NN trine Uranus and MC, NN trine Neptune,NN sextile Sun! Though the tightest orb is for NN square Venus.\r\n\r\nSo I wonder how do I really read my Nodes and itâ€™s aspects situation?"
