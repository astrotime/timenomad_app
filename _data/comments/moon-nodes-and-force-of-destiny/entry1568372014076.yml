  It's safe to say that everything "works" in the sky but in different ways,
  often rather subtle and not so obvious. Each of us tends to experience
  astrological forces of planets and the nodes through the viewpoint of one's
  own chart's framework. This mean that certain things never work for one person
  while the other person's experiences will be rather opposite. And that is
  completely normal and expected. What is needed is a transpersonal standpoint
  that allows to accept nuances and irregularities, an approach that avoids
  conflicts of views and broadens the perception of this world. This world and
  the creation are truly endless!
