  Jupiter is holding a square to your Nodes. But by itself Jupiter isn't a very
  "manifesting" planet. Yes, it can bring luck but one needs more than Jupiter
  alone to succeed. Look at your NN position, it's in the house of creativity.
  Look at the "productive" planets like Mars, Saturn, Venus, how can they help.
