  To put it simply the Moon on your past and Mars in on your future and all that
  is amplified by Jupiter. Looks like a personal configuration where the native
  is likely to oscillate between “what I feel” and “what I do”. There can be a
  pull towards emotionalising and over-reflecting that makes one feel
  uncomfortable about proactively moving forward. Past lives likely to be spent
  in contemplation. But the future actively challenges that. A recipe of being
  somewhat emotionally unsettled, work on grounding is requited. Need for active
  checking in with reality and making concrete steps. It’s a kind of conflict
  between two rather incompatible principles (Moon and Mars just don’t mix). The
  golden path forward requires achieving clarity in every situation, that can
  align both planets on one common goal.
