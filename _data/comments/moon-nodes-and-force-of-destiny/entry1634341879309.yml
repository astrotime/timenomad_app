  Venus on the North Node points at the search for harmony as the way forward.
  But Mars adds unneeded venom and that may confuse your system. Most likely
  your Moon is unnecessary bashed by an excess of emotions (Venus-Mars are good
  at that). First goal is inner peace, identifying and letting go of
  self-loathing. When the Moon is suppressed, nothing helps more than extended
  periods of time in nature.  That will balance emotions and allow for letting
  go. Nature can truly show you that youâ€™re not alone, loneliness is a very
  convincing illusion.
