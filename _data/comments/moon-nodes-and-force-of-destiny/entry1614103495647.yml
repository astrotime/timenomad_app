message: "Amazing article! I’ve been trying so hard to figure my path, but I confess that a lot of times I get more confused with what’s manifested in my life than clarity over what I should be doing!\r\nI have Jupiter in Aquarius on the 2nd house squaring SN in 11th Scorpio and NN 5th Taurus. Jupiter in the 2nd + Taurus NN in the 5th are like “JACKPOT”, right? Well....I can say the reality is exactly the opposite! Scarcity is winning - by a lot! But I guess that’s the challenge, right? Been trying to embody the abundant, loving and joyful mentality for years by now, but the reality in my face really hits strongly and honestly, at this point, I really really have no idea how to align with this NN path (sorry if my English was bad, I’m not American, lol)"
