message: "Thank you for this article!  So much goodness in here not shared elsewhere I have read.  I am still at a loss though, sadly.  I am in the process of looking at my placidus vs whole sign natal chart to see which applies to me (I was born near the Canadian border).  I tend to resonate more with whole sign at the moment, though.  Lots more research and learning to do before I can really say...\r\n\r\nHaving said that, in placidus, my NN is in my Taurus 1st house (Aries ascendant @ 28).  In this system/placement, I have a trine to Moon in my overly large 6th house Virgo, a square/semisquare to Mars (at 0) in my Libra portion of the 6th house (it’s about 1/2 Virgo and half Libra in placidus), and a trine to Pluto in my Virgo 6th.  My SN in my 7th Scorpio house has a semi square to Mars in my Libra portion of my 6th house.\r\n\r\nWith whole sign, I have my NN in my Taurus second house with a trine to my 6th house Virgo Moon, a square/semisquare to Mars in my Libra 7th house (at 0), and a trine to Pluto in my Virgo 6th.  My SN in my Scorpio 8th house with a semisquare to Mars in my Libra 7th house.\r\n\r\nThose are pretty big changes when you consider 1st/7th vs 2nd/8th houses, and therein lies my struggle to define my path.\r\n\r\nIn both systems, I have Mars (ego, drive) blocked energy on my SN and NN but with a balance of trines and square/semisquare to soften that tension?  \r\n\r\nDoes that blocked energy become mute in that case?  Does that make me overly egotistical/narcissitic and lazy?  Or does that make me introverted and high maintenance?  lol... But then add in the different houses each system has my nodes in, I’m confused as to how that all would ‘look’."
