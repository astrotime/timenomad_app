message: "I‘d take it as “the values of the Black Moon have a strong influence over my past-to-future trajectory.” Meaning the need to take the Black Moon seriously and learn to respect its influence. Look for what is Black Moon in you, learn to understand your own “shadow.”\r\n\r\nAnd watch its transits over your natal Black Moon position (every 18 years) and also transits over the nodes (every 9 years).  It's time to strive fro clarity, as opposed to be swayed by emotions."
