message: "\" i suffered more and more bad consequences, the world dont tolerate this kind of atitude, people who run society want conformism and herd mentality.\"\r\n\r\nIn a sense in your response you have more validated the influence and effect of the nodes than disproved it.. Because going toward and manifesting your life direction indicated by house and sign position of the NN, involves just as much of a resistance, hardships and difficulties as you happen to be describing. \r\n\r\nYet life keeps bringing us back toward the direction and goals indicated by North Node until we master them through as many trial and errors as it takes. It's both life direction and destiny and there is no way of avoiding it except leaving it as an extra karmic baggage in the next rebirth. \r\n\r\nWe all have our own NN challenges to deal with and our SN indicated skill, faculties and tendencies are the key toward learning how to handle and overcome the challenges of the NN. \r\n\r\nVery best wishes to succeeding with yours."
