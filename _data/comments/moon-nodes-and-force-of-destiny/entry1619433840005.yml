  Square is certainly stronger than trine or sextile. Your SN-NN arrow is moving
  from Pluto/Scorpio (wow) towards Aries with Venus helping. I'd say the values
  of Venus provide a creative challenge to harmonise the movement from hidden
  and undeground towards outward fire and action. Look at the house where your
  NN is, that could give an extra clue as to what chapter of your personality is
  being targeted by this transition.
