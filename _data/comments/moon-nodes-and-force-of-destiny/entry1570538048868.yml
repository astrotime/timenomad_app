  I wouldn’t worry too much. The “same sign” isn’t really a factor that projects
  any significant influence. Check if the Sun and the Node are in conjunction,
  only then there is a tangible accumulation of energies. And even then as
  everything in astrology, it can play itself out in a number of ways (some
  easy, some challenging) depending on multitude of other factors.
