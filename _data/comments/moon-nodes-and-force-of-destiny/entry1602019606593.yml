message: "Thank you for an informative and well written article. \r\n\r\nI have the dragon guarding my IC and MC. My South Node in Virgo is a real dragon, itself guarded by Uranus, Jupiter and Pluto, Jupiter parked exactly on it at 26 Virgo and left Pluto to take a 4degree conjunction and Uranus a 3. \r\n\r\nI feel that part of my lonely North Node remains hidden deep beneath the Piscean Sea. From the there it makes a 0°00' trine to Neptune in Scorpio, it doesn't get more nebulous than that, NN completes the Grand Water Trine with a 0°19' trine to MC in Cancer, and closes the Kite with a 0°19' sextile to the IC in Capricorn... a fact I was unconscious of.\r\n\r\nMy mystic rectangle includes the dragon, Neptune, Jupiter, Mercury, and Uranus. On top of that I have a Grand Water Trine that includes MC, dragon's head and Neptune. In the past year I spent many hours reading on and trying to understand these configurations, and recently woke up to the fact that Saturn is about to transit my IC at 27 of Capricorn.\r\n\r\nI had an extremely traumatic childhood but as I'm writing this, I have a big smile on my face because I'm about to Unleash the magic of the dragon, and the devil has reared his ugly head. Jealousy from incapable people who wont make it even if I were to deliver the Dragon Plan at their door step. This is not just business, this is my North Node, my destiny, my purpose on this planet. It is not theirs and that's not going to change just because they are stuck, evil, thick headed and jealous. This is my path and i'm determined to turn it into reality. I took closer look at my chart and realised that I've got everything I need to make this a reality. \r\n\r\nNN at 26 Pisces, SN conjunct Jupiter at 26 Virgo, MC 27 Cancer, IC 27 Capricorn. Capricorn is a cold and harsh place for the extra sensitive IC, this explains my harsh childhood. The only consolation is that Saturn's influence at both the top and bottom of the sky at the time of my birth keeps me upright. The dwads revealed that Pluto, my chart ruler (Scorpio rising), is linked to Taurus my 7th. When not causing major damage, Pluto is a great anchor. Pluto and Saturn sitting on the angles, I've got what I need to unleash the dragon."
