  At this stage it’s a partially manual, the automated search function is
  coming. For now just remember that Saturn cycle is about 29 years. So find any
  conjunction using the time scroller (you can jump by a week at a time). Once
  you have Saturn somewhat conjunct, long tap on the aspect to show the Chart
  Event Explorer and you’ll be able to reveal exact dates of transit (or regular
  aspect).
