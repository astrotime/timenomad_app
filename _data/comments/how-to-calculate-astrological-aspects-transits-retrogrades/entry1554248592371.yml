  Yes, Time Nomad works with both sidereal and tropical zodiac models. Set your
  preferred zodiac model in the Settings menu (top left corner under the gear
  icon) including your choice of ayanamsa. The app is free in its base version â€”
  allowing to test it thoroughly before deciding if it suits your needs.
