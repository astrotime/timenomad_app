message: "The idea is that Time Nomad can find exact timings of events that are shown as happening. I am planning to create a broader search, and gradually working towards that goal.\r\n\r\nThe way to do that now is to use \"Chart for Now\", turn on fixed stars and aspects with stars (use the \"Show\" options). Also, in the \"App settings\" turn off Arcturus as it's too close to Spica and will confuse you.\r\n\r\nThen filter aspects to trines and step by day until you see the Moon trine to Spica. Tap on the chart and then \"Stars\" to see the event is taking place. From there you can tap on it and get exact times.\r\n\r\nAround 9 December it'll be waning Moon trine, not what you want but you can keep scrolling through time until you find next trine, etc. The next waxing trine in around Jan 5, depending on your time zone."
