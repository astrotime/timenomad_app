message: "Enjoyed this post! Thank you!\r\n\r\nMy Jupiter is the Midpoint of:\r\n- Sun/moon\r\n- Venus/Mars (exact to the minute)\r\n- Pluto/NN\r\nHave been curious if these Jupiter alignments have more power to Positive Jupiter blessing ;) LOL “One can Wish”  right?! ;)\r\n\r\nIf there are further articles regarding the importance of MidPoints, I personally would enjoy learning further on this topic.... As well as seeing this as a configuration with your App! \r\n\r\nLastly, I use this App the very most of all the other astrological apps out there > Keep up the good work and additions, it’s been SUCH a useful tool for learning and practicing Astrology :)"
