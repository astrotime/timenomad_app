message: "Hi Alice, the easiest way is to use \"Contact developer\" in the app (under the top left corner cogwheel icon menu). I will be able to guide you through. But ultimately the procedure is simple: 1) In \"App Settings\" make sure Chiron is ticked on in \"Planets & points\", and tap on \"Save\" two times - on that screen and then on the main settings screen; 2) Use the \"Show\" (bottom left corner) on pretty much any screen to see what planets are on/off for that particular screen. \r\n\r\nAll Time Nomad screens are highly customisable and becoming familiar with the \"Show\" options opens new dimensions in working with the app.\r\n\r\nAnd any further confusion, please email me with some screenshots. I will respond promptly."
