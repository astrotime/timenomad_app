message: "There is one â€“ \"World Events\" and \"Summary\" that is a simple calendar. Yet it doesn't tell what to do. It's up to the individual to interpret and decide for themselves. It's not obvious as to what effects in what areas a certain configuration will have. Learning to recognise patterns and apply that to one's daily awareness is a more powerful approach compared to relying on fixed advice.\r\n\r\nToday is a good example. Full Moon pretty much coincides with the Sun exact square with the Nodes. This can manifest at many levels, both personal and global. Personal levels can range from \"peak of personal achievement paving the road forward\" to \"watch overexcitement as it may lead to future downfall\", and that would depend on numerous other factors in the person's natal chart and current transits.\r\n\r\nFor the fun fact, the stocks today seemed to react negatively to this event. Just like they did exactly two weeks ago. Emotional blow up?"
