  Nobody is perfect at astrology and you can absolutely learn it, just give it
  some time and don’t rush or worry about not getting something. It’s a
  discipline that sinks into you with time, can't force it. Get a book that
  teaches the basics or join some course. You’ll be surprised in year or so.
