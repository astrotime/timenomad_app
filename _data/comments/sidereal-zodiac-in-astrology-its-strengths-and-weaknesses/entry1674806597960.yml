message: "**Why does the Western astrology predominantly use the tropical zodiac?**\r\n\r\nOne, for historical reasons. The Western zodiac came out of time when both zodiacs were pretty much the same. Two, the equinoxes and solstices provide the basis for the calendar and time measurement. Three, the zodiacs drifted apart very slowly and there wasn’t much difference for a few hundred years to be bothered about. And eventually we’ve figured out that the seasons have their own symbolism and that works with the tropical zodiac.\r\n\r\n**Why are plants likely to be more receptive to the sidereal zodiac?**\r\n\r\nIn short, a staggering difference in complexity.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the answer lies in the difference in life force (prana) and astral bodies of plants and humans. Plants occupy a much more narrow part of spectrum. Meaning they are often specialised, like for example cucumber and watermelon have strong Moon resonance, avocado relates to Venus, etc.  Plants are all about growth (life force), thus they strongly depend on what astral energies the Moon picks up as it travels across the starry backdrop. Plants have direct energetic linkages to specific stars.\r\n\r\nHumans are way more complex, our astral body represents the whole solar system, as in microcosm reflecting macrocosm. No person can be simplified to one-two planetary energies, there’s always a dynamic interplay between all planets. Perhaps seeing oneself as a spinning solar system could reflect the degree of complexity we have to deal with. Human astral bodies are incredibly complex and so our lives. Can’t say that about plants."
