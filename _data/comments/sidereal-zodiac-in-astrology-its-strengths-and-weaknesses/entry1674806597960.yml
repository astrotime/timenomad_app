message: "**Why does the Western astrology predominantly use the tropical zodiac?**\r\n\r\nOne, for historical reasons. The Western zodiac came out of time when both zodiacs were pretty much the same. Two, the equinoxes and solstices provide the basis for the calendar and time measurement. Three, the zodiacs drifted apart very slowly and there wasn’t much difference for a few hundred years to be bothered about. And eventually we’ve figured out that the seasons have their own symbolism and that works with the tropical zodiac."
