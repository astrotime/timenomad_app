  Good point, thank you for the explanation. To sum it up: the vernal Equinox
  day was decided by the star rising above the horizon just before the sunrise
  thus allowing for visual observation of the morning of the day of the vernal
  Equinox â€” albeit introducing the shift of the Zodiac sign boundaries.
