  there is plenty of space right here on earth and we have all that we need. I
  don’t think you touched too well on A.R’s point of the demonization of other
  cultures use of astrology, which funny enough is very western of you. I’m new
  to Astro and really enjoy this app for learning would hate to have it ruined
  by western bias. Hopefully you have POC and Black people on your team to help
  with different aspects on all of this.
