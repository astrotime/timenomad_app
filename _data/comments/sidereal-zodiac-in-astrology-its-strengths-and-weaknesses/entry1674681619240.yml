  thank you for this. It lends some understanding to the puzzle for me. I am
  thinking the equinox and solstice points lay the framework for the yearly
  solar journey. I am a gardener and both the Farmer's almanac and the planting
  calendar for biodynamics, uses the sidereal zodiac. Their experiments have
  shown that it works for plants. So my question is why humans use the tropical
  (I am definitely an Aries, not a Pisces) for characterological interpretations
  and plants grow better in a sidereal zodiac.
