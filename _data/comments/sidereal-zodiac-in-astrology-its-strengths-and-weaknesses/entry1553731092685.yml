message: "Excellent presentation on the differences between the two zodiacs.  There is another side of the sidereal zodiac that I have discovered, that in ancient times, prior to horoscopic astrology, that the zodiacal constellations were not calibrated directly, such as the Sun sitting on the border of sidereal Aries and Pisces at the Vernal Equinox  which you refer to as not being possible to see, but that the constellations were viewed from their helical rising position which shifts their location approximately half a sign - see \"An Age Old Mistake That Still Haunts Astrologers\" @ \_https://macroastro.wordpress.com/2016/03/14/an-age-old-mistake/"
