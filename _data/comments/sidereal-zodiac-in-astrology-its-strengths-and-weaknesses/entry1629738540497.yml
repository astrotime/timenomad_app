message: "I'm suspicious of the interpretation you have between India and the West, where Sidereal is \"gods telling you what to do\" and Tropical as \"free will\" because of how much of Western culture is Christian indoctrination that's still today causing widespread destruction, with a very blood-soaked history of butchering all other cultures it comes across and extensively demonizing them. In fact, I think it would be reversed: Tropical is static, unmoving and disconnected from Reality, from what is actually Material (and quite literally \"stuck in the Past\" and western science actively discredits Astrology rather than incorporating time-tested traditions that have been around for waaaaay longer), and Sidereal is moving, changing and in alignment to the actual positions of the Celestial Bodies. Earth is part of a community, you cant say that Tropical is \"closer\" to Earth when the very tilt that gives us seasons also changes. Seasons in this context are exclusive to Earth, the Stars are not bound by its rules.\r\n\r\nPlus, I'm suspicious of you for framing colonizing space as any kind of good thing when in our actual real life, it is a very bad thing and is actually in the process of killing all of us."
