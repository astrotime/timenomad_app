message: "The Christian/Western problem exists due to the fact that so many people equate Christ and Church. Yet they are two very different things vaguely related to each other. Christ can be better understood as Spirit. Church is Religion, meaning a human organisation that follows its own agenda that is loosely based on teachings of Christ. Making this thought even shorter: Spirit and Religion are not the same. Spirit is Absolute and beyond human domain while Religion is more akin to a billionth reflection of Spirit through the system of smoke and mirrors. Religion is a human institution that’s why so many unjust things has happened throughout human history usually justified by referencing God and therefore being righteous. Alas, humanity is very slowly (if at all) learning through its own mistakes, that’s being like this since day one and will continue into foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nSpace colonisation is certainly a bad and very uncomfortable idea, little doubt about that. But we’re running out of space here on Earth. For example, if you wanted to start a new society following your ideals and you have gathered some people around you, where’d you go? There’s no free unoccupied and uncensored space left on earth. It’s all taken. All existing governments without exception will do their best to smash any alternative society. What a dilemma indeed!"
