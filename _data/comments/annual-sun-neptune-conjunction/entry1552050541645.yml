message: "I‘m a Stay at Home Mom, Homeschooler and Wife, who’s very creative, intuitive, and passionate. Unfortunately, feeling stuck for over 8 years, I don’t know what to do career/goal wise. My day to day routine has become mundane and I’m frequently daydreaming and procrastinating a lot. I have several Retrograde planets. As a newcomer to astrology, I’m starting to wonder if Neptune-R is the reason. What part of my chart do I need to focus on?\r\n\r\nI have several Trines to Neptune-R:\r\n•6th house Neptune-R (16 09’)in Sagittarius\r\n•10th house Moon (10 18’)in Aries\r\n•2nd house Saturn-R (10 22’) in Leo-also trines 10th house Mercury (04 22’) and Moon in Aries\r\n•11th house Venus-R (24 08’)\r\n\r\nOther Aspects\r\n•5th house Pluto-R (13 11’) in Libra sextiles Neptune and 2nd house Saturn\r\n•10th house Sun (29 57’) in Pisces\r\n•5th Pluto-R opposes both 10th house Moon & Mercury\r\n•12th house Jupiter (27 25’) in Taurus sextiles 10th house Sun\r\n*Sun, Moon, Mercury conjunction\r\n*N. Node-R in Libra (24 22’)\r\n*10th house Mars (0 27’) conjunct Midheaven (8 23’ 26”) in Pisces\r\n*Mars square Jupiter"
