message: "Oh, sure! Having Neptune in the first house impacts Neptunian values on the personality, big time! Also look for possible aspects of Neptune. Generally speaking, Neptune makes the person very sensitive and really open to higher inspirations. But, as with any other planet, there are challenges of Neptune — it brings too much water resulting in excessive noodling and not being able to put any of intentions into practice. On the health front, Neptune makes one’s energy way too open and thus facilitates unneeded energetic enmeshments, plus the whole alcohol/drugs/addiction drama. With Neptune it’s very much like listening to the Sirens and getting destroyed. Doesn’t mean that Neptune is a “bad” planet? Far from that, its potential is huge and truly cosmic! But Neptune requires very precise handling and knowing exactly what you’re doing. Otherwise too easy to get lost.\r\n\r\nThe best advise is to use the will and drive of dynamic and practical planets like Sun, Mars and Saturn. Saturn is especially good for this as it gives the ability to be practical, down-to-earth and brings a healthy degree of dryness, which is very helpful in the case of overly watery Neptune. What could be a good strategy? Concrete, small, everyday practical achievements is the best cure for the downsides of Neptune. Once the person is actually busy working and implementing concrete projects then Neptune can help by bringing its inspiration and ideas, kind of “background inspiration” mode. But it doesn’t seem to be working the other way — experiencing ideas and visions without working hard everyday leads nowhere. Big gift comes with an equally big challenge!"
