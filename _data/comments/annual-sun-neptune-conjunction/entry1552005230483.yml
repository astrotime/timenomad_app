message: "Mars–Saturn tight conjunction is the one to watch. Those are the two planets of opposing principles: Mars is forward going and hot, Saturn is introverted and cool. That may easily result in swings depending on situation. Mars–Saturn often comes with self-imposed guilt and limits and a set of semi-conscious taboos. That blocks the flow. Work on yourself to recognise any kind of limits that you may have imposed onto yourself, in many cases they are no more than self-constructed illusions. Always be either working (meaning having a job) or engaging in physical movement (walking, exercising regularly). That will loosen Saturnian inhibitions on Mars. Healthy Saturn will help Mars a lot!\r\n\r\nOnce Mars–Saturn has been improved, it would allow for greater access to willpower and will nicely hold Sun–Neptune opposition. Mars–Saturn is extremely powerful when working well, it just takes some work to get it right."
