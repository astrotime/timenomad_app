  The sextile aspect carries the symbolism of unfoldment and opportunity. Having
  the Sun in the 10th house points at the active stance towards doing and
  achieving in the world. How you do and achieve could be influenced by the fact
  that your Sun is in Pisces, obviously ruled by Neptune. This could manifest in
  professional activities that, at least at the inner motivational level, relate
  to the ideas of universal good and contributing to others and the society, or
  even artistic endeavours. Neptune sextile will chip in occasionally providing
  an extra boost of its influence to already Piscine Sun, and that will be more
  tangible during periods of Neptune being aspected by some other planet. A good
  approach is noticing the transits of natal Neptune and seeing what changes
  they bring in a way your Neptune relates to the Sun.
