  I agree, it’s a very challenging aspect to have, I’ve got about $10 million
  dollars worth of great business ideals that I write, structure and creatively
  speak about, yet have not been able to execute, it’s also a toxic planet that
  it can invade and cause havoc onto your health as I’m dealing with diabetes,
  heart disease, and hyper thyroidism , fortunately I have a Saturn and Jupiter
  in Capricorn, which as somewhat allowed me to become more focused and
  determined to stop the negative effects of Neptune, I’m quite inspiring,
  creative, but I wouldn’t promise it on my worst enemy because it dissolves
  your ability to be a prominent force in life, I hate it sometimes
