  I have the sun in gemini 9th house, opposite neptune (in Sag 3rd house), trine
  Saturn and Mars (basically merged into one planet, 25 02 and 24 52) in the
  11th. Most of the time I can  get stuff done, but now and again the water
  wells up and washes it all away and I have to start again. Neptune is
  retrograde in my birth chart too, I wonder if that has any influence?
