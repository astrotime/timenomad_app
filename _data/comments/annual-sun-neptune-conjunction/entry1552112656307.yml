message: "The common confusion about Neptune is that one takes it too personally. But Neptune is not a “personal” planet, so to speak. Personal planets like Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn and Jupiter influence us in a direct manner, we can relate to them because we can see them with our physical eyes, we actually receive their light. Transpersonal planets (Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) have much more diffused and broad, one can say “background” influence. Their influence is usually transmitted to each individual through the personal planets.\r\n\r\nRetrograde transpersonal planets (Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) are regular events due to their very slow movement and don’t have a direct personal impact. They may impact another planet through a hard aspect (conjunction, opposition, square) and somewhat alter how that planet manifests in one’s personality.\r\n\r\nIn the case of your chart — and your words — it’s the Moon that is loud and clear. It may receive some subtle coloration from Neptune via the trine but I wouldn’t focus too much on that. The main dialectic in your chart is between the Moon and Mars that is reinforced by the Moon in Aries (Mars sign) and Mars in Pisces (Moon + Neptune sign). There is no aspect between them but they are in the same 10th house representing your potential for doing in the world (career, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe Moon–Mars is a challenging but promising combination. The Moon is watery and reflective, Mars is fiery and direct. Together they don’t work well as Mars tends to either overheat the Moon or the Moon swallow direct fire of Mars in its endless malaise. The downside is being compulsive but not productive. The good side is a passionate nature, hot feelings, being able to be in love, burning imagination.\r\n\r\nSo I’d say a good idea is to work on separating emotions and actions. When you do you do 100%. When you feel you feel 100%. Mixed together they become a fiery soup, not productive and very confusing for meaningful actions in the real world. Perhaps a good idea would be finding a project (perhaps about people) that you feel passionate about. And then follow it up thoroughly separating doing from feeling and emotions. You can actually get quite successful with your Mars on MC and square Jupiter which is a very good aspect for action."
