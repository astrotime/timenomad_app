message: "Any planet counts. The most important factor is how tight the conjunction is. Spica is one of the most significant stars, it is positioned right on the ecliptic. \r\n\r\nPluto has a rather high inclination of 17ยบ, ie it travels up and down with relationship to the ecliptic. The closer it was to the ecliptic the more powerful that stellar conjunction is expected to be.\r\n\r\nIn any case, Pluto and Spica conjunction has an important influence on the chart."
