  I have a question about rising stars. What does it exactly mean when we say a
  star is “rising”? I thought that rising meant closer to the ascendant (or over
  the ascendant). For example, I have the star Regulus very close to the
  ascendant degree. But I look at the “rise/set” tab report in the app add-on,
  it only shows me the star Markeb as rising, which is in the same sign as the
  ascendant, but very far from the ascendant degree, and under the horizon. Why
  is it only Markeb considered rising, and not Regulus? The same goes for
  another chart that I was looking at: Sirius is exactly on the ascendant
  degree, but it only shows Pollux as a “rising” star. Thanks!
