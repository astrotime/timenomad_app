message: "The best way to find out is to do extended star gazing, ie an eye contact with the star. Acubens is very vary faint though, hard to see. \r\n\r\nThe other factor to consider is how far the star from the ecliptic. Acubens is about 5ยบ which is relatively close but Altair is about 29ยบ which is quite far. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, spend time gazing at those stars and see what you feel. The experiential pathway is the easiest when it comes to the fixed stars."
