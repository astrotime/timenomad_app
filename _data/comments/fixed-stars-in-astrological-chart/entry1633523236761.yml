message: "I understand harmonics and think it’s a fascinating direction for research and new ideas. I’d recommend books of John Addey, for example, Harmonic Anthology. Don’t recall him mentioning fixed stars much. The main thing to remember with harmonics is that the higher number you go the more error you get – imprecision of birth time grows very fast as one approaches the 20th harmonic.\r\n\r\nTechnically speaking, nothing prevents us from applying harmonics to the stars. There may be some interesting results. That probably makes sense in cases of a star to planet conjunctions. Yet individual stars don’t really relate to the Zodiac signs the same way as the planets do, there’s always a risk of not getting meaningful information out of their harmonics."
