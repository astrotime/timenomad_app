message: "It could be not an unfortunate chart but rather misunderstood one. Things like that could happen when one somehow chooses to avoid doing what really needs to be done and therefore finds themselves in a perceived cul-de-sac. A certain reframe of attitude and incentives is required. Charts aren't fixed in terms of good/bad, they are hints to the native to discover their own unique path that approaches challenges in a creative way.\r\n\r\nStars that are too far from the ecliptic aren't really conjunct in a classical meaning of the word: Fomalhaut and Alkaid can be safely ignored.\r\n\r\nThis leaves Regulus, Antares and Spica as the main influences. Perhaps less fighting and more harmonising can open up new venues. There's power there but all powers require great intelligence and perseverance, they don't come easy or automatic. It's a call for deep self exploration."
