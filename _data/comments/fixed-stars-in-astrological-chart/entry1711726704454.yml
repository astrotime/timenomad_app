message: "Do you have any sources for delineating a chart, particularly an unfortunate chart that, has several of the major fixed stars strongly aspected? I have so many, but now in my second half of life have not experienced the benefits. Only poverty, chronic lack of recognition and bad luck, endless bully boy narcissists salivating for my death and ill health. Life is essentially a sixth house hell hole. \r\nSun conjunct Regulus\r\nMoon conjunct Antares\r\nMC conjunct Fomalhaut\r\nMars conjunct Spica\r\nVenus conjunct Sirius/Ascendant\r\nSaturn conjunct Alkaid"
