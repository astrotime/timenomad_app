  It doesn't matter. Fixed stars are simply "points". You can use tropical or
  you can use sidereal, whichever your prefer. Fixed stars are better aligned
  with the sidereal zodiac, for example Antares (of Scorpio) will be in the
  Scorpio sign in the sidereal zodiac but in Sagittarius in the tropical zodiac.
  But that won't influence anything else.
