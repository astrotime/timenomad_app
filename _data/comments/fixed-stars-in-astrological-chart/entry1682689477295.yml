message: "Hello, Time Nomad\r\n\r\nWhat happens if you have Vega exactly conjunct Capricorn rising, Cancer Descendant conjunct Sirius, and Pluto Conjunct Arcturus/Spica, at 23 degrees Libra, part of a Libra stellium (Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Pluto)? Do these influences contradict each other? And another question, are the houses in which the planets conjunct fixed stars are important as well? Cause Pluto is in my 9th house, in Placidus House system, but in my 10th in Whole House System. I do not recall extraordinary things to happen in my life, that is why I am confused. \r\n\r\nThank you!"
