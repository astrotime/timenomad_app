  The New Moon at Aldebaran. Solar eclipse due to conjunction to the nodes. The
  north node is at Pleades. One can think of life where new beginnings are
  important and transformative. The values of generosity and optimism would pave
  the way forward. Identifying old behavioural patterns and moving away from
  them is crucial.
