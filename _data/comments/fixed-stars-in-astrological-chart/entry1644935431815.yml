  I wish I could get a report but I dont have an iPhone to download the app. Is
  there another way to get a thorough report? I know that aldebaran is exact
  conjunct my sun and Antares is exactly conjunct my Jupiter. But I really want
  to look into a full report and all aspects. Any suggestions? Or news on
  whether and when this app will be available on android?
