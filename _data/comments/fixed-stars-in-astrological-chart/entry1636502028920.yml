  Ankaa is a rather far from the ecliptic, about 40ยบ away. Given the conjunction
  was at night time, it's likely to be related to something deeply subconscious
  and not necessarily easy to grasp with our ordinary daytime logic. See other
  conjunctions, and perhaps stargaze on the star itself. This may give you a
  certain feeling you can pursue further.
