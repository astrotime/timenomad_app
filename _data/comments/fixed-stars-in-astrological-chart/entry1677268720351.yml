  Hi Rylee!  Before I downloaded Time Nomad [or even knew it existed] I found
  Claudio Silvaggi on YouTube and with a few details provided by me, he prepared
  my sidereal Natal chart for free and emailed me the details of it.  What a
  WOW--that was!!!  He also offers You a follow-up ZOOM session [optional and
  free too] to answer any questions You may have and clarifies any significance
  in Your Natal chart.  He has a YouTube channel full of videos related to
  sidereal astrology.  He also has at least one video about astrology apps.  It
  Helped me decide for Time Nomad as I have an iPhone.  Swift & direct wishes as
  You Journey on the path to Self knowledge!  J9
