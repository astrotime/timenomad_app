message: "Rising/setting stars are to be understood in terms of the altitude/azimuth coordinate system. This relates to the 24 hour rotation of the earth where some stars rise and some set with respect to the visible horizon for given geographic location. Rise/set are not related to the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nThe rising star is the one that is crossing the zero altitude in negative to positive direction. The setting star has the opposite movement. All with respect to the current horizon."
