  Always look at the star proximity to the ecliptic. Vega and Sirius are rather
  far, so they won't have as strong influence as Spica conjunct Pluto which I'd
  say is the strongest influence. I personally prefer the Placidus system as
  it's more sophisticated since it works with time segments as opposed to a much
  more simpler Whole House system. The 9th house points at long studies/journeys
  and having Pluto/Spica there would give hints at deepening your life work
  using learning opportunities.
