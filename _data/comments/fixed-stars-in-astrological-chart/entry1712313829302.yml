message: "It could be helpful to see the fixed stars as sources of astral energies. So are the planets of the Solar system. The influence of a star comes through a resonance between the light of the star and the light of the planet — at the time of their visible conjunction. You can see that in the night sky yourself, just do some stargazing.\r\n\r\nCusps of houses are hypothetical points that don't radiate any energy or light. It's unlikely they will have any significant resonance with stars… with the exception of the angles (Asc, Dsc, MC and IC) as those are fundamental points delineating the celestial sphere."
