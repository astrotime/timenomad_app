  Fixed stars is the hardest thing to interpret. There are numerous books
  written on the topic yet it always feels like the star elude any human
  quantisation.  I have previously mentioned the book _The Fixed Stars And
  Constellations in Astrology_ by Vivian E. Robson, it's a good work to
  illustrate how immensely complex the field is. In my opinion, the best way is
  to build your own experience through stargazing and careful observations. It
  takes time but it's a fascinating journey that no book can match.
