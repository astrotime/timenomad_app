message: "Firstly, the app doesn't create reports along the lines of \"what does it mean in the case of my chart\". It only gives a general narrative about specific aspects. I can refer you to the book _The Fixed Stars And Constellations in Astrology_ by Vivian E. Robsonâ€¦ but still it only gives a generic descriptions which may be quite cryptic. A better approach is to work with a human astrologer who understands the fixed stars.\r\n\r\nAs for the Android version, no plans for the foreseeable future. I am a solo developer and maintaining the app for just one platform takes all my time."
