  Thank you for this helpful information. I noticed that Alpha Crucis is listed
  in the graphic of the 15 Behenian stars (I think? It's whited out a bit but I
  see it at about 14 degrees in Scorpio). But I don't see Alpha Crucis or its
  constellation (southern cross or crux) in the following table. Is there a
  reason for this? Thank you!
