message: "The fixed stars are tricky indeed! I don't know of anybody specific who I may say is proficient with them. From my personal experience these two practical things help:\r\n\r\n* only bother with the stars that your planets are conjunct with\r\n* out of those stars, only bother with the stars that are relatively close to the ecliptic\r\n* then spend time stargazing those stars and feel how they resonate with you, what do they make you feel\r\n\r\nThis way you can build your own relationship with the star in question. Asking somebody to do that work for you won't necessarily bring deep insights."
