message: "A grackle landed on my mirror and strangely looked straight up spinning his head while looking straight up beak pointing to the Sky above... I looked at the chart of the moment for the location I was in (Fla) and the Black Moon was exactly aligned the Mc (midheaven)... This happened a couple more times... Then the next time the grackle moved position on the mirror did the same... Eris was aligned the Mc... I went outside and talked to the divine feminine about the upcoming phoenix rising on April 14/15th 2023 on 0°Aries and while my eyes were closed a single small cloud came by in a clear blue sky and rained on me for literally seconds I opened my eyes to see the little cloud go by... This is what Black moon does... Deep spiritual Signs... Denis is so awesome to make such a remarkable app and this type of learning... cheers to our bright future as written in the stars... ❤️\U0001F64F"
