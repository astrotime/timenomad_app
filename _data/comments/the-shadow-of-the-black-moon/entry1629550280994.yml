  Well, that’s a fascinating placement, a kind of double Pluto in its own house
  of sex, death and occult. Basically a very strong independent personality with
  some deep occult potential. How much that is implemented in life that’s
  another question but the force is there. Greatly benefits from discernment and
  exactitude, the Black Moon is good with that.
