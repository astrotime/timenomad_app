  I was first introduced to the Black Moon when I received a full reading of my
  natal chart using the Clairvision Virtual Astrologer. Correspondingly, I felt
  "removed" from the concept, not quite able to "connect" with it; however,
  you've now made it profoundly easy for me to understand, and I sincerely
  appreciate it. Thank you.
