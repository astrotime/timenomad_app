message: "I absolutely love this app. How it took me so long to discover it… only the stars know. Get it? \U0001F92A\r\n\r\nAnyway, thank you for such a great app. \r\nI’m fascinated with sidereal so this app is great much info. \r\n\r\nI noticed my black moon is opposing my north Node in 10H Gemini. \r\nI get this feeling that I’ll never get to complete what I came here for just because it’s so hidden. Lol \r\nMy sun (Leo) in 12H squares my black moon as well. \r\nLife doesn’t seem hard but I can’t seem to grasp it even though I know there’s something there. Lol\r\n\r\nMany thanks of you do provide feedback. \U0001F64F\U0001F3FB\r\nCan I be a guinea pig? \U0001F917"
