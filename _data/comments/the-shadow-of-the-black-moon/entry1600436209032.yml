  The Black Moon on the ascendant, fascinating! You could be rebellious and
  desiring for absolute. Perhaps the need for independence. Seeing deeper into
  other people psyche. A lot depends on other aspects of your chart, how the
  Black Moon integrates with the rest of planets. Still, itâ€™s a strong
  influence. The Black Moon is a bit like Pluto, but not quite. You can look
  into your Pluto and try to discern the difference. That would be a great
  exercise in deciphering yourself!
