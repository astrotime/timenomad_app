  The age ranges are from the works of Heinrich DÃ¤ath on medical astrology
  (around 1908). In his works he refers to "well marked periods governing human
  life" and climactic periods happening around those years that affect both
  physical and mental balance of a human being. As for the infinity sign...
  well, who knows when life ends, so keeping it on a positive note.
