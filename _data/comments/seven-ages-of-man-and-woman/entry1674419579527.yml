  All periods before 64 express themselves via active life force, that makes us
  grow, expand, procreate and organise. Saturn is the epitome of age and as such
  doesn't relate well to life force active movements. As the available life
  force dwindles, people tend to narrow their focus on what's timeless (Saturn
  is Chronos) for them. It's not natural to be as active as before and that's
  not the right time as the clock is completing its cycle. This article is not
  to be seen as planetary cycles, it's more of a symbolism of the human travel
  through the spheres that have certain correspondences to the visible planets.
