  The Zodiac Man was used in medieval medicine to determine the correct time for
  surgery, medication, bloodletting, and other procedures. The foremost rule was
  to avoid interfering with a body part when the moon could be found in its
  corresponding sign. This injunction was attributed to Claudius Ptolemy :
  "Membrum ferro ne percutito, cum Luna signum tenuerit, quod membro illi
  dominatur." Wherever the moon and stars are aligned with a certain
  astrological sign, they correlated with a body part, bodily system, or the
  four humors. The four humors separate the body into four parts just as there
  are four elements. The four humors of the human body are yellow bile, black
  bile, phlegm, and blood; it was believed that these all needed to be in
  balance in order to keep up with your health. These humors were used directly
  to treat illness alongside Zodiac Man and were also used to explain and
  simplify concepts to patients. Europe was, at the time, required by law to
  calculate the moon’s positioning before taking action on a patient or any kind
  of medical procedure. If the moon was not in its correct positioning, nothing
  was able to be performed because it was deemed unsafe. They used a volvelle, a
  rotating calendar, to calculate the moon’s position as well as multiple
  almanacs which described different phases of the moon.
