  You have to look up your entire chart and consider the positions of all
  planets. Discover where the majority of the planets are concentrated in your
  chart. Sometimes it's 1 sign, but more often - 2 or 3. And focus on these.
  Looking up JUST where your sun is (month and day of birth) is a very
  insignificant purveyor of information by itself.
