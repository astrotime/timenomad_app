  You can go to astro.com and get your birthchart for free. You go to free
  horoscope and you put in your birth date birth time and birthplace.  You can
  see your birth chart than you can look for the placement of your sun. The
  Planets are telling you what kind of energy they represent. The sign tells how
  this energy will be expressed. The house tell you in which part of your life
  it's going manifest. For instance sun in Aries in the first house.
