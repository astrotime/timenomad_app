message: "Claudio this is so intriguing what you wrote.\r\n'1011 at the alpha, east, rising, Aries 7077 at mid day - sunâ€™s 7 lights ROYBIV light you can see 9099 at the omega, West, setting , libra 3033 at the mid night - all light you cannot see.'\r\nI don't know why, but I see those numbers repeated constantly...and feel drawn to them. How did you start to study Fibonacci numbers? And has studying the numbers and sequence assisted you somehow in your life? Just wondering. Janel"
