  The Uranus–Pluto square did not leave us much time for a reprieve from rapid
  changes and the need to adapt to ongoing transitions. Simultaneously, the
  transits of Neptune and Chiron in Pisces are also reflected deep existential
  questions arising from the growing awareness of the ecological trauma we are
  experiencing. Since Pisces represents closure, many people today sense a
  global “end of times” feeling, particularly because of the decline of natural
  resources, the rapid extinction of species, and the intensification of extreme
  weather patterns. Will there be a new dawn following the dissolution of so
  much that has been taken for granted? These intense and complex transits could
  in fact be precursors to the cycles coming in the year 2020.
