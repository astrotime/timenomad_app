  Pepper, we are endless/infinite.  This I know for sure.  We are in a very
  important portion of our journey on this wheel.  We are cleaning the
  images/vibrations that no longer need to be.  When we do what is good and tune
  in to these vibrations the guidance becomes very clear.  We are here to seek
  kNOWledge / wisdom and to realize that the material aspect is a
  distraction/test.  The only messages you should get from an animal/insect/etc
  is their totem/spiritual message :-).... Peace and Cheers!
