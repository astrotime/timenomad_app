message: "Perhaps ignore Pluto-Neptune sextile, it’s a weak indicator plus those planets are extremely slow, it’s a generation-wide aspect.\r\n\r\nThe “big gun” is the cluster of Pluto-Saturn-MC-Venus. There’s some really interesting stuff. It certainly impacts how the person does things in their professional life. Saturn-Pluto works if one can really own their Pluto, otherwise one may feel “caged up”, running in circles and wondering why things never change.\r\n\r\nNeptune in the 12th can signify both spiritual tendencies or mystic abilities but Neptune is tricky to handle well due to its nebulosity, [read more on that here](https://timenomad.app/posts/astrology/event/2019/03/04/annual-sun-neptune-conjunction.html). Saturn-Pluto can apply immense amounts of internal pressure and one may turn to all kinds of intoxication (usually alcohol and drugs) because they need to “let go”, but that’s not a good idea – clarity lost yet nothing really resolved.\r\n\r\nUranus in the 11th may manifest itself in unconventional and possibly eccentric friends. Uranus likes changes and social agendas, one may find more engagement in projects oriented towards social good, especially knowing that Neptune in the 12th.\r\n\r\nA much better handle is dealing with the Sun-Saturn conjunction. That’s a really powerful aspect that can handle all others. Structural side of Saturn does well with the Sun energy, that’s provided one rises above the dictatorial modality of the Sun. Be bigger than yourself, that would provide a valid direction."
