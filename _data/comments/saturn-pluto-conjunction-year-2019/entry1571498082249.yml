  I'm writing a book on the Pluto Scorpio transit/generation and I am myself am
  a Pluto Libra.. I honestly can see a definite difference in the people I have
  interviewed for the last year and it is a very marked before and after. Even
  though I am about to turn 44, I tend to be a little bit of a "oh, I bet you
  remember the library and the sound of summer," and I feel like I am sounding
  like a relic yet I am finally feeling like I am actually MY age and not the
  number, but I have been in the newsreels and I don't want to be any other day
  that is not Now only with all the memories and maybe a little bit of a season
  pass to not die from some sort of freakish ailment that is only supposed to
  happen to cats. I ask for a lot but I'm not ENTITLED because I have LIVED so
  much for my time. Does that make sense?
