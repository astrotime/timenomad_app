  Hey Zach, I can feel ya.  I'm Oct 63 and the grand conjunction of Pluto
  -Saturn is Conjunct my Natal Saturn.  One important note is Eris is now in
  Aries.  500 years in the making.  She is definitely getting into our heads. 
  Eris plays a  major part to our external weather as well.  She is showing her
  strength in being a major player for hurricanes and tornadoes.  I see the
  golden angle aspects playing a part.  More study to follow, Thanks to the
  TimeNomad App....
