message: "Hey there, I would like to discuss with you the repeating 60 numbers from the Fibonacci sequence which defines the zodiac.  Must take he last digit of each sequential number i.e. 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144... which gives 1,1,2,3,5,8,3,1,4,5,9,4,3,7,0,7,7,4,1,5... etc till 60 iterations.  It then repeats exactly.  \r\n\r\nFrom this 60 you will find 0's at the cross, you will find 5's at the twelve zodiac sings, you will see\r\n\r\n1011 at the alpha, east, rising, Aries\r\n7077 at mid day - sun's 7 lights ROYBIV light you can see\r\n9099 at the omega, West, setting , libra\r\n3033 at the mid night - all light you cannot see.\r\n\r\nThere is so much more I'd like to share with you to help you, all I ask is that you add this too you app :-)\r\n\r\nPlease contact me at claudio.silvaggi@gmail.com"
