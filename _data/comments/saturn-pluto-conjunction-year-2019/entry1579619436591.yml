  Interestingly, David Rockefeller, one of the richest and most influential
  bankers in the world, was born under a Saturn–Pluto cycle (conjunction), and
  so were Rupert Murdoch (opposition), head of a massive media empire, and Bill
  Gates (square), founder of Microsoft and listed as the wealthiest person in
  the world for a number of years. Similarly, Saudi Arabia, a country that
  possesses some of the largest supplies of oil in the world, was established
  under a Saturn–Pluto opposition.
