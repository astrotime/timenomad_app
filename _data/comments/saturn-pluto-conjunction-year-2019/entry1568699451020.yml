message: "This conjunction is at present on my own natal Saturn ie. my second return, but then in January at the exact \r\nconjunction it is sitting conjunct my Mars/Venus conjunction (as Uranus opposes my Moon/Neptune conjunction in Scorpio)....arghhhh! I am trying to leave one trying loving but non-passionate longterm relationship and enter a more sexual another that promises nascent love hope but has already faced restrictions and disillusionment. Also experiencing sudden bodily accidents and problems alongside it producing strangely adolescent in love reactions - very contradictory! Am nervous about getting severely hurt and bad decisions whilst feeling no less vulnerable of heart than at an earlier age...def feel one of my life's challenges is resilience in the face of constant challenge on all levels BUT is there hope of something joyous relationshipwise for once coming out of such intensity limitation and hard emotional and physical slog Timenomad??"
