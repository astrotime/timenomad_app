message: "Hi Janel, It is very intriguing.  I saw the video \"John Coltrane's Discovery of a Music of the Spheres (original)\" by David Cochrane's Astrology.  Further from there I see so much more.  You can watch a couple of the video's I've made on my youtube channel \"Iyoutome\".\r\n\r\nI've also been studying magnetism and it is totally the primmer of creation/manifestation and hence astrology, physics and meta-physics.  Once realizing the golden ratio is a part of everything, I can now witness and predict with some degree of accuracy weather both external and internal.  Golden ratio aspects in astrology are more important than western astrology realizes.  The quintile and bi-quintile are considered minor aspects which in fact are golden.  Venus and Eris are key as they are fundamentally golden with the 3 golden triangle making the penta star.  Note that the 60 repeating numbers make the zodiac and the cross / swastika.  This is the DaVinci code... Peace and Cheers"
