  Just like in architecture, structures appear as a result of significant amount
  of directed deeds over certain periods of time. Repetition brings structure
  and structure means repetition. If somebody comes with a luggage then yes they
  can be seen as structures. But others can come with structures designed to
  dismantle previous ones. Think Genghis Khan for example, the guy had lots of
  structure and he used it to wipe out previously existing structures. So it
  usually goes both ways, somebody erects, somebody demolishes. The balance of
  Saturnâ€“Pluto is usually tilted towards correction, not necessarily demolition.
  But excessively weak or antiquated elements do get removed to give space to
  new growth.
