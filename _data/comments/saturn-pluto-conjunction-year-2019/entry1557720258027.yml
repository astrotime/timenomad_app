message: "Problems with authority mostly come from Uranus. Progress in career will require some faster moving planets like Mercury, Venus, Mars that always benefit from help of Jupiter. Saturn may get one stuck in a certain configuration for longer than needed. Pluto brings implosions and the need for transformation. Saturn-Pluto is a really good topic for a blog post and I may write one. \r\nIn regards to your chart, look for aspects. Yes, you have strong Saturn which isnâ€™t that bad because you can build a career in professions that require exactness of the mind. The question is what is your Pluto is aspected with. That will give you some ideas as to how the energies will flow. Hard to tell more without seeing the whole chart. Two planets never paint the big picture. My advice is to analyse the aspects!"
