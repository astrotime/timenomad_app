message: "This just gave me an entry key into the Quintile and BiQuintile aspects. The Quintile being five points (aka dots), with the affinity for interdependencies and associations, leading to a desire to create, to shape and to form. A point, represented by dots, is the beginning, sorta, which contains all that is created. My vocabulary may not be precise, but I hope you understand what I mean. \r\nFor the BiQuintile, five lines. A line is the distance between two points. That means moving away from the initial point onto the next point, but in such a way that there isnâ€™t a deviation totally from the goal which the first point is trying to achieve. Sort of an improvement of the first point or dot. \r\nWhereas the Quintile initiates a creative process from the point or dot, I see BiQuintile as having a letting go/ moving on quality with the goal of mitigation or improvement of the Quintile process by connecting the dots and drawing the line."
