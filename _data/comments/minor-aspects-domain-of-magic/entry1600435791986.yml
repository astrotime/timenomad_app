message: "Hey Brittany, I can offer a few points but please treat them as my humble opinion that doesn’t necessarily reflect the reality. Astrology is inherently complex. Plus… that’s without seeing your chart so there’s a LOT of gaps in my understanding of your astral profile.\r\n\r\nQuincunx or inconjunction is a 150º aspect, a shift across 5 zodiacal signs. That’s certainly speaks about rearrangements as the zodiacal wheel gets turned and shuffled. May mean a life time of changes and reorientation towards future incarnations (if you believe in them).\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the strongest star is made by biquintiles (144º) that’s the pentagram, a classical symbol of occult powers. Charts of some powerful people, both spiritual and anti-spiritual, have nearly complete pentagrams. But that’s extremely rare.\r\n\r\nIn the case of your chart, I’d recommend to start without asteroids and minor planets. See what kind of geometry you get. Most of the stuff comes from classical planets. Asteroids are fancy but too tiny compared to real celestial giants.\r\n\r\nThen look at major aspects between the planets and see what kind energies are there. You may get quite far with that kind of interpretation technique. And after all, what you feel is true, you know what you know – no matter what any astrologer would tell you!"
