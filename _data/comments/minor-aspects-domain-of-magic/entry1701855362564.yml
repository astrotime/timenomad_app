  108ยบ is a tridecile/tredecile or 3 times 1/10 of a circle which gives the
  ratio of 3/10 or 10/3 which produces either 0.3 or 3.33333... the number 3 is
  seen as a divine symbol, the world of the gods, the sky of the gods. Having
  Neptune in the 8th could point at special theurgical abilities, a practical
  connection to the heavenly realms. How much that is dormant or active is
  another question. But the energy is there and that's supported by the Sun
  creative momentum.
