  Indeed, the “Thor’s hammer” pattern is happening right now, I am adding a chart for July 2019 below to illustrate your point. The next story titled [“Minor astrological aspects and the domain of magic”](/posts/astrology/philosophy/2019/07/01/aspect-patterns-building-blocks-of-charts.html) is covering the Thor’s hammer pattern.

  \r\n\r\nThe “Thor’s hammer” pointing at Mars makes me feel somewhat uncomfortable taking the currently brewing world conflicts into consideration. Especially knowing that Mars is also square to Uranus. Some seriously dangerous fire!"
