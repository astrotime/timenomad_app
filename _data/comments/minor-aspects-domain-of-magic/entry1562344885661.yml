message: "Two sesquisquares linked by a square (as in Jupiter / Neptune right now) make an aspect pattern called \"Thor's Hammer\". Alice Portman and Linda Reid have written about it.\r\nMost of the images in your very interesting article aren't being displayed on my screen, in fact the only one I can see is the pentagram right at the start. Very frustrating! I've tried to fix that but have not succeeded. If you have any ideas about it, I'd be grateful to hear them."
