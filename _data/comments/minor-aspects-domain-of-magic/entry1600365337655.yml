  Help! @Time Nomad... I hope you still monitor your comments. I pulled my birth
  chart with all planets and asteroids included and quincunxes as well. The
  chart produced has a 5-pointed star shape created by the quincunxes. I have
  tried to research this phenomenon, but I am only getting results of blogs and
  those who have a fascination or obsession with it... I have an intuitive
  feeling that this has a profound meaning for me about the transformation of
  trauma and ancestral wounds into healing power for myself and others... but I
  cannot prove this. Please give me your opinion/advice on this phenomenon.
  Thanks.
