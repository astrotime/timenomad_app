  Some astrological symbols have a number of variations. Time Nomad uses the
  five line symbol for the quintile to pass the geometrical meaning of the
  aspect - the division by five. By design Time Nomad gravitates towards a more
  symbolic visual language. Another example, can be the Pluto pictogram.
