message: "I haven't done much work with 165ยบ possibly because that's is just another way to say 15ยบ aspect. As with many aspects it's all about the way one looks at them. \r\n\r\nGenerally speaking aspects don't exactly resolve in specific psychological features. Aspects are more like certain types of connectors between planetary energies, which in turn do result in psychological features in an individual.\r\n\r\nOn the practical side, perhaps finding time when two planets are 165ยบ in the sky and tuning into them to see what would that aspect mean?"
