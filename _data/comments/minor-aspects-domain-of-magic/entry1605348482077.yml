  Me too Brittany ! Thank you for asking. My grand quintile pattern wouldn’t be
  complete as the quintile from Venus to the moon is 6degrees rather than 3
  degrees orb. However Ceres/Demeter at 3 degrees Gemini is conjunct moon at
  nine Gemini which has always felt important to me. A case of taking the
  asteroid Goddess energy of Great Mother into consideration with gratitude
  rather than relying on everyday “moon” in pondering the gifts and challenges.
  The bi quintile from Chiron in Cap to the moon Gemini is exact however, so it
  feels like a bit of a corridor between 3and 9 degrees?? Best
