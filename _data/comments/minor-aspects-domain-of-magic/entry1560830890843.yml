message: "Not really, the article doesn’t place humans anywhere specific. Human consciousness spans all the way from the upper echelons (the Universe, Spirit, God or whatever one prefers to call it) to the Earth itself, and sometimes even further down. \r\n\r\n“Magic” is a domain in its own right, it’s not unique to humans, but rather a universal principle of action applicable to all  beings."
