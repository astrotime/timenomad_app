  My radix has a preponderance of a particular aspect. Uranus to Saturn to Mars
  to NNode to Neptune to Venus are each aligned in a chain by 165º(.08º-1.39º
  from partile). They seem to be several planets short of an eleven pointed
  star. I've corresponded with Ricki Reeves who authored "The Quindecile"' her
  name for the 165º aspect. She describes it as being an obsessive-compulsive
  influence. Of course, 163.6͞3º would form a precise "star". Have you used the
  quindecile? Do you think the magical undecile applies here?
