  Would you be willing to look at a pentagram and Yod which is present in my
  chart, and tell me more about the angles/degrees? I have a pentagram in my
  chart, near perfect, but not perfect - I also have a perfect Yod going down
  the middle of it. I'd love to understand more about the specific degrees of
  the pentagram in my chart but I'm unable to measure them precisely..
