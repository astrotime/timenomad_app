  Another clue to understanding the continuous movement and interpenetration of
  the planetary cycles is the concept of applying and separating aspects. In
  looking at the interaction of any two planets, as the faster-moving of the two
  approaches, or moves toward, the exact aspect with the second planet, it is
  said to be applying. The aspect is then exact by degree. As the faster-moving
  planet moves away from being in aspect to the second planet, it is then a
  separating aspect, i.e., moving past the degree of exactitude, or separating
  in its influence. Therefore, if Saturn is at 15 Pisces and the Sun is at 10
  Cancer, the Sun is in an applying trine (or applying to a trine) to Saturn.
  If, at the same time, the Moon is at 12 Libra, she is in a separating square
  (or separating from a square) to the Sun. Although this may sound complicated
  at first, it is a good way to help remember that all the heavenly bodies are
  in constant motion (although, of course, at greatly different speeds, as we
  have seen) and in constantly shifting relationship to each other.
