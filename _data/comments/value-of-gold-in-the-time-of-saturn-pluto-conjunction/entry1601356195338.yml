message: "The graph illustrates a relationship between “owning foreign assets” and “owing money to foreigners”.\r\n\r\nThe period of 1914–1947 saw an influx of foreign money/debt into the US due to two world wars. The US was getting lots military orders, foreign capital poured into the country.\r\n\r\nThe following period of 1947–1982 enjoyed ongoing stability. Great constant wealth based on redistribution of the “money heap” from the previous period.\r\n\r\nBy 1982 the US economy spent the “fat” and accumulated sufficient debt that began to drag it down. But debt is a good thing for financial markets. The period of 1980–2020 saw economic growth via the means of newly invented financial instruments. But debt inevitably reverses the chart since the country now owes more **foreign capital** than it is owed to. It can be seen a flip of the period of 1914–1947.\r\n\r\nThe graph is going down simply because currently we’re in a debt-fuelled economy phase. It will continue going down until economies begin to default, or the next war, or a major technological breakthrough, if we’re lucky. \r\n\r\nGold prices saw **relative drops** around the years 1920, 1949, 1970, 1976, 1985, 1992, 2001, 2015. Yet on the large scale the gold price doesn’t really reset, it just keep going up. Here’s the graph of [macro trend](https://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart). There can be many factors, not necessarily always coinciding with astrological conjunctions.\r\n\r\nI think the beauty of the Saturn–Pluto cycle is its duration (33-38 years) that so far seems to correlate with the broader economical situation. Shorter cycles have more randomness."
