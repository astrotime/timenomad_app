  Great article. I’m hopeful that there will be some positive steps taken from
  all this, that’s how Pluto transforms right? There are some other factors at
  play but I don’t know whether they have been involved in previous
  conjunctions. For example how does Uranus in Taurus play a role in this? And
  what is it about wars that is good for the economy?
