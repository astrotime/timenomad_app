message: "Uranus is in fall in Taurus, this period covers years 2019-2026. One may say we shouldn‘t expect anything revolutionary in terms of large societal or scientific shifts. Which goes well with the whole Saturn–Pluto dynamic which is about applying pressure and thus testing for truthfulness and resilience.\r\n\r\nWhy wars are good for economy? Significant wars come at the end of economic cycle, often as the result of countries overburdened by their debt and unsolved problems. Wars allow to wipe the slate clean: default on obligations, cancel the debts, etc. They are acts of creative destruction that removes the old and establishes the new. Good for business that survive or those that feed war efforts. Terrible for all of us involved."
