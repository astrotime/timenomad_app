message: "Hi, agree with your analysis but little doubt over Saturn Pluto conjunction. As per the graph, From 1914 to 1947 cycle why economic conditions were higher and flat in 1947 to 1982? Why its down till today?I think  some other planetary aspects or conjunctions are playing role. \r\n        Regarding gold prices, Saturn Jupiter conjunction reset the value of gold. This conj. happened in 1961,1981,2000,2020."
