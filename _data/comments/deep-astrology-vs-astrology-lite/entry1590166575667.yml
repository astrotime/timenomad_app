  Many thanks for these substantial contributions, especially the integration of
  historical economic and sociopolitical contexts. The statement “Pluto is the
  force that comes to power when the time is due” was personally revealing to
  me. My explanation: Looking back, I noticed that I was always worried about
  upcoming Pluto-Saturn constellations - my radix shows a square aspect between
  the two. In fact, there were always enormous demands, so afterwards I wondered
  how I got through this time unscathed. If I understand the above statement
  correctly, Pluto examines the personal attitude of accepting a challenge or
  not and if you assume it  gives the strength to master it. That sounds
  encouraging and liberating.
