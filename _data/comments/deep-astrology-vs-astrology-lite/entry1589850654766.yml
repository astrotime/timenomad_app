message: "Great comment! I agree that the key is in understanding of your own “structure of the self” and thus becoming ever increasingly more real and not being affected by commonly marketed delusions.\r\n\r\nAstrological vision of time is another component in this equation. “No man is an island” – we all live in the context of a bigger environment (the world) that will never cease to bring about changes and disruptions. Can these be predicted and how do we improve our chances? That's a huge question that squarely puts astrology into the category of its own — no other human discipline (so far) gives us tools to preview the signs of upcoming changes."
