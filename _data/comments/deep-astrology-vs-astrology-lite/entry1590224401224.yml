message: "Traditionally speaking, Pluto is the archetype of transformation, Phoenix style. Pluto governs underground nuclear forces (stuff like nuclear energy). It's a difficult planet to handle unless one embodies its energies, then it's a different story. Pluto often makes things hidden and that's something to be aware of. With Pluto it's a good idea to understand your own deep (and perhaps) hidden nature and see your life through the lens of unavoidable changes and transformations, that's the Pluto way.\r\n\r\nSaturn naturally resists changes, it's the symbol of structural stability. But when the structure isn't healthy (read \"our economy\") it will encounter significant difficulties meeting transformative energies of Pluto."
