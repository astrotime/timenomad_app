  Poor darlin! Squares are hard. I would send you to read Charles Eisenstein for
  a more positive spin on things....I'm holding out for an awakening encase that
  we are all connected and if we steal from another, we first steal from
  ourselves something more precious...if we strike out someone, we sustain the
  blow first to ourselves. (Right vs left anterior cingulate gyri etc). Short
  term selfishness will teach us to be kind and generous....eventually.
