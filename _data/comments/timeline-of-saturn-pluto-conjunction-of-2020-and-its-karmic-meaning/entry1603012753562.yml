message: "Hey! Yes, I tend to agree that past the point of its exact moment the conjunction‘s effect and strength are going progressively downhill. From my observations the power of an aspect is increasing towards its exactitude. \r\n\r\nIn a personal process the separating period does give us time for maturation and digestion of what has happened. Meaning we shouldn‘t “drop” awareness of the aspect right after its exact moment but keep working on integrating its influence until the final separation of planets.\r\n\r\nThe world scene is a different story. There‘s much randomness overlaying cosmic influences."
