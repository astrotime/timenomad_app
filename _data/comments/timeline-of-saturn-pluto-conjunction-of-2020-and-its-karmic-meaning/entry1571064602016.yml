  You write some really great stuff and some of it I can actually relate to. Now
  you must be in USA and I am in UK. So, squeeze and grind. I'm born square 1956
  as were many, but my lovely Saturn on asc and the the fabulous Pluto on mc.
  Stopped in every way throughout my life, always being squeezed to look after
  someone in family, I'm getting too old now however I am still doing it. Pluto
  forwards equalled Turkey getting a green light from Nellie the elephant Trump,
  in Uk the High court threw out the 1950s claim for getting their pensions back
  stolen by government. Next year Oct 3rd again Pluto forwards 2020. The only
  real difference will be that the nodes have changed. To them that has it shall
  be given and to them that has not (POWER in particular) it will be taken away.
  Governments not seeing people as humans. Women and children last. Lots of
  sympathetic talk from Neptune. Life going backwards. Did anyone reading
  Astrology in the year 2000 plus ever expect food banks and dire poverty
  everywhere. Well yes, it was written. Sometimes I wonder what life if for, its
  so destructive.
