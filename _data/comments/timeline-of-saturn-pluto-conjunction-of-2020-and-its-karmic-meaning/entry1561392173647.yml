message: "Let's not forget that Jupiter joins this conjunction in the summer of 2020. This is both a demarcation between cycles of control having to do with nuclear weapons and also the start of a new generation. The Nuclear Generation? It would be important to study the history of 1947 transit more closely so as to understand the non-disasterous event as well as the disastrous one (1914/15). I suspect that since the old USSR gained hydrogen bomb parity with the US in 1949 the dye was cast in '47 somehow with regards to the so called Cold War. Fate is fatal, but destiny is destination. \r\n\r\nI like your pointing out India Pakistan. If a nuke were to be fired between one or the other because of diplomatic neglect centered around our current \"president\" then we would be awakened indeed to our current situation. Hopefully it is a political illusion that the lines of communication are frayed now. \r\n\r\nWe need to get the charts of Putin and Trump in here, as well as the mundane charts of Russia and the US nations. Complex stuff, but if we do not analysis it, who will?"
