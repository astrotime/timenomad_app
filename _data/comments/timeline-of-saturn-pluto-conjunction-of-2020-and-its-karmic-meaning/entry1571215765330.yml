message: "A great question about nanotech and AI! Just as many other truly powerful things the new technologies will equally help and hurt humanity but won’t destroy it. Many similarities with nuclear power, one can go to war against others or one can produce energy and venture into unknown territories (take serious space flight, for example). Some painful learnings will emerge along the way but nothing new to humanity, just a different domain. It’s all very relative.\r\n\r\nSocial media works through its power of convenience at the cost of physical separation, human contact and interaction become more abstract. Hence the emerging phenomenon of “remote” attitude in human relationships."
