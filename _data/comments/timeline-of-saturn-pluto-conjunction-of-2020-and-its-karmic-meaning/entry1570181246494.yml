message: "The cycle of Saturn is long, approx. 29.5 years give or take. The planet travels through the houses of your chart pretty much like a symbolic hour arm on a watch face. Its transit through each house acts as a mini chapter of life: “Saturn and who I am”, “Saturn in relationship to how I earn living and take things from the world”, “Saturn in my closest surroundings and family”, etc. \r\n\r\nWhen transiting Saturn returns to its initial natal position, that moment marks a completion of that nearly 30 years cycle. It’s not exactly a momentous “judgement day” but rather a transitionary period to the next cycle of Saturn. It’s either entering the next phase of life, or “rinse and repeat” because the lessons haven’t been learned. Most people live their lives in ever repeating cycles of patterns, and that’s considered normal.\r\n\r\nOne can’t “fix” their Saturn, but if one lives to maximise the good sides of Saturn (precision, perseverance, accountability, …) then the next cycle will be more interesting. Like moving to next octave up.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, fears is one of typical Saturnian challenges, especially when Saturn aspected with Mars. The best advice I had is to ignore fears and keep moving regardless."
