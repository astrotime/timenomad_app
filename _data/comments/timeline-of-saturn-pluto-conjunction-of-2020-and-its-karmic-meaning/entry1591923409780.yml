message: "Thank you Sarah, much appreciate your feedback! Based on my own experience, there’s never been a single book  on astrology, astrology is best learned by reading lots of different sources and gradually figuring out what makes sense and what doesn’t. It’s an ongoing journey, where you constantly discover new things through the process of… discovery. A virtuous circle! \r\n\r\nYour teachings question got me thinking… So far I haven’t considered making teachings out of my work. Perhaps I could if enough people were interested – yet another potential project for the future, we shall see :)"
