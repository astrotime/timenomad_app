  Taking into account monetary policies of the last 20+ years the US government
  doesn’t really need an external enemy. The 2020 brought the challenge that
  isn’t over yet and is likely to fully unwrap itself within next 10 years.
  Everything is so over leveraged that we may only guess the consequences. What
  is obvious is that the “old guard” will be printing money as long as possible
  simply because no politician has the guts to pop the bubble during their term.
  So we’re all waiting for the perfect storm to come and wipe the slate clean.
