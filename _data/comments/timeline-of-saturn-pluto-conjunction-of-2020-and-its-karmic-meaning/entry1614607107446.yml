message: "What do you think of the drop in US Treasury prices since the start of Dec 2020? Saturn & Pluto together are predicted to make bond prices fall and therefore interest rates rise. It appear that is was true. Even thought this conjunction was supposed to end in January, bond prices keep falling. I know you've said it is not a sharp change with these 2 planets.\r\nThis could also be a modern form of war, with foreign countries trying to make the US Government unstable through monetary attacks, and the COVID-19 stuff would aid in that attack. If interest rates keep rising, the us government needs to generate funds to pay those bond holder the higher interest rates, and at these insanely high debt levels, it seems that will be difficult. May you live in interesting times."
