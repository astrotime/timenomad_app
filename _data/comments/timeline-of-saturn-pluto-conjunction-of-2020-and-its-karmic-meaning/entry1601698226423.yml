message: "So odd I stumbled into this! As if it was meant to happen. I was praying and noticed the sky. I've had this skymap app for years..\r\nI decided to use it tonight.\r\nAs I was in awe of Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto I thought hmm.. Let me research this. \r\nI feel and have been feeling this all happening, if that makes sense. Everything going on in the world, what's right is wrong, what's wrong is right, totally upside down. Thank you for making sense out of it for me.  I knew there had to be a connection."
