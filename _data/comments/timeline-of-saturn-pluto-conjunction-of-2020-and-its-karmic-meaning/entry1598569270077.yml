message: "Saturn–Pluto conjunction is a \"slow\" aspect, meaning it develops over 1-3 years and its effect would be of a broader, global nature. Such conjunction may have personal effect provided its orb is tight and it has other connections.\r\n\r\nTough life can be the result of two opposite principles. \r\n\r\nThe first – **too much stuff** like lots of aspects that challenge each other. The person needs to work on understanding and untangling unconscious behavioural patterns, learning new ways as opposed to following their well known ways.\r\n\r\nThe second – **not enough aspects/forces** – a kind of emptiness that make it harder for the person to match their life circumstances and succeed. This problem calls for working on increasing personal skill set through systematic studies and professional growth."
