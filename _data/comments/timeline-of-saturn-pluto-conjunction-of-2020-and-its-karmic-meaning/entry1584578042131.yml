message: "This is very interesting, and not a little disturbing given what we are going through now in March 2020. The article can be forgiven for not seeing the Coronavirus coming, but it’s broad outline is correct. Jan 12 2020 was about a month into the initial outbreak in China. Spot on.\r\n\r\nYou don’t get much more Saturn than the shut down sweeping across the globe, with whole cities and countries having to force their populations to stay at home. And Pluto? Well apart from the massive brush with mortality we’re about to take a huge economic hit which will probably mean a massive global restructuring. \r\n\r\nSo I would say: well done this astrologer. He got it right."
