  I don't think there's a clear indication of that. Saturn-Pluto event has
  released toxic forces that now swirling around the world. It will take some
  time until things stabilise. Viruses are kind of organisms that have their own
  consciousness and they don't necessarily work as an on/off switch. We're in
  the new biological reality that will produce a new equilibrium of forces.
  We're just getting used to it, albeit painfully.
