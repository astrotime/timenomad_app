message: "Mars is a very fast moving planet and its influence pales in comparison with the heavyweights like Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto. Mars can bring temporary aggravation and bursts of volatility which clearly took place during its short passage through the conjunction during last 20 March – 5 April. By now it's gone out of alignment. \r\n\r\nWorld changes always come with conflicts of interests. Perhaps there could be certain military outbursts but we don't know for sure. What is more prominent is the shaking of foundations initiated by the influence of Saturn–Jupiter–Pluto. Will America hold or will it begin to crumble? How will other countries reconfigure and adjust. A lot to observe and think about!"
