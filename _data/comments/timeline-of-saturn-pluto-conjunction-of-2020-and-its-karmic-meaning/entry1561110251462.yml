  Thanks for the data and the interpretations. One of the significant things
  about 1982/3 is that because of the events leading up to the Able Archer
  exercises we almost, according to former Defence Secretary Robert Gates, got
  into a nuclear war with Russia. This seems thematic with regards to
  Saturn/Pluto conjunctions, escalation of nuclear destabilization and
  restablization. A lot is going to depend, it seems, on who wins the 2020
  United States election, a hot headed megalomaniac or someone with a more level
  head.
