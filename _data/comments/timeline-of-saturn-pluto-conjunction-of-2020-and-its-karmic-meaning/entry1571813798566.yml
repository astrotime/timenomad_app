message: "Saturn/Pluto 2020 and the thing nobody talks about is the conjunction IS conjunct the South Nodes of both planets in Cap.\r\nCome on Pluto entered Capricorn and the world would get much more conservative as the pendulum swings. USA as the bell ringer is showing the way. Trump vs every other structure that was spawned at the Uranus/Pluto conjunction in the 1960s. It's not just him, it is the majority of the population. Their children are overdosing on synthetic heroin. Dying in the streets. The anything goes culture produced this. Suicide of young people is up in this country by 56%! \r\nThis is Berlin 1933, debauchery and destruction. This is when the Frankfurt School left Germany and came to America. They set up shop at Columbia Univ. and UC Berkeley and decided that America was not ready for destruction so they went with \"Cultural Marxism\"\r\nto destroy American families via culture.\r\nIt's all coming down in 2020. America will fall to the victors, the flyover gun toting dis-employed and then mocked \"trailer trash\" that cling to guns and bibles.\r\nAfter all Neptune did come home to Pisces to facilitate a mass movement based in faith.\r\nl"
