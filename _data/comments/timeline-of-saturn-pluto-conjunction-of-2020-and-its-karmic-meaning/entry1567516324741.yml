  Saturn–Pluto is a gradual event, it’s not a punctual happening. Both planets
  are slow and their actions span many months. I don’t think it’s a personal
  event but rather a world-wide trendsetter. As to Mercury trine… Mercury by
  definition isn’t a heavyweight and trine is a harmonious aspect. Doesn’t look
  significant at a personal level. Aspects to Mercury are of fleeting nature.
