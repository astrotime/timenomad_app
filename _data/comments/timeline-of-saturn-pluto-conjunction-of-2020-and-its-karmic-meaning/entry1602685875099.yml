message: "Dearest Time Nomad, \r\n\r\nFab stuff. Such clarity. I'm an astrologer and I doff my astro cap, non linear simplicity with regards explanation is a wondrous trait, you have it . Curious that you feel a separating orb needs to be 10 degrees to truly end a cycle, in a finite way. Do you not feel that once that separating orb motors past the 3 degree orb the impact is progessively lessened?"
