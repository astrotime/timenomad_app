message: "`birth ➝ growth ➝ accomplishments ➝ wisdom`\r\n\r\n`heart ➝ clubs ➝ diamonds ➝ spades`\r\n\r\nOur life stages beautifully mapped via the 4 suits of the pack of cards. And within each suit we find 13 cards (Ace to King), marking the journey from wish to mastery, from the beginning to the next level of consciousness. And yes, Saturn and all his buddies also play a role, because they denote the creative process that starts with Mercury (mind) and goes through the stages until Neptune, which heals and dreams up new ideas, which in turn will be processed by Mercury again after one's birthday.\r\n\r\nSo many systems, so much value, so much joy!"
