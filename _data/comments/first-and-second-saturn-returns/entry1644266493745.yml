  Hi Alison, im 60, and saturn  has now passed over his degree at birth, hes in
  his own sign of my bithchart, so showed up on my physical , body, Capricorn ,
  being an earth , sign, caused a solid stream of dental , problems for 6 years,
  25 capricorn, finally resulting in a 9 tooth bridge .I had always taken great
  care of my teeth, prior.  After the bridgework was completed, with no further
  problems expected, 7 months went by, , then saturn retrograded, back onto the
  degree, And another trip to the dentist, revealed a small bone fragment , had
  been left inside the gum, under the bridge, and was causing agony for a few
  days, until it was removed. ! The bridgework was done just as covid began to
  go global, and everything was getting locked down. Thats my 2nd saturn return
  story, !!!
