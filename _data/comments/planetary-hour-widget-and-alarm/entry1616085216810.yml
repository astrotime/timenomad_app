message: "Two requests to improve an excellent product.\r\n\r\n1) Could you include the numerical hour of the day (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) in the Planetary Hours widget?  I keep time naturally, so that's quite helpful.\r\n\r\n2) An alarm function that allows me to set it for the beginning of the 12th hour of night, solar noon, etc. would be quite useful in getting up on time, staying on track, etc.  This would need to be a proper wake-up-type alarm."
