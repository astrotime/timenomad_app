  No plans for an Android version at this stage. Sorry, I really wish I could
  answer yes to this question. Time Nomad is a pretty big (and native) app which
  makes it super challenging to support across multiple mobile platforms without
  making it much simpler. Plus being a solo developer I have to prioritise my
  efforts all the time, it's only me here.
