message: "The planetary hours are defined by sunrise and sunset times for each specific location. You can find more information in [this article on the nature of planetary hours](/posts/astrology/philosophy/2018/11/23/what-is-planetary-hours-part-one.html)\r\n\r\nSo the answer is \"neither\" â€“ no tropical nor sidereal model is required for the classical definition of the planetary hours."
