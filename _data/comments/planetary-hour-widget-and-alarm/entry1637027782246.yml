  Try this: in the app tap on "Widgets" (under top right corner menu) and change
  notification settings slightly. Then dismiss the widget sheet by swiping it
  down. Then restart the device. And lastly, in iOS Settings app look into
  "Sounds" and make sure that "Ringer and Alerts" volume isn't too low. This
  volume setting controls notification sounds.
