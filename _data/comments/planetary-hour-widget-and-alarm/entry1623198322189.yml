message: "If you have TN notifications enabled (meaning not disabled via the Settings app) and you do receive text TN notifications, then try this:\r\n- go to \"Widgets\" and change the Sound/Voice/Text  switches to some other configuration\r\n- then IMPORTANT: swipe down the \"Widgets\" sheet to activate those settings\r\n- restart your device - sometimes notifications get stuck and need that"
