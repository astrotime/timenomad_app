message: "The numerical order is possible and it does make sense to have it. I'll think how to put it nicely there.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, you'd like to have sunrise, the 6th hour and the sunset alarms, right? The alarm function is only possible via a notification sound, for example using a longer and louder sound. But if your phone is silenced for the night then it won't come through... a usability problem obviously."
