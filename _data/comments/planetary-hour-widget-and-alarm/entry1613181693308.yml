message: "There's a different widget called \"Moon Cycle\" that solves that. But it's a pre-iOS 14 widget meaning it only appears in the Notification Center. You can add it by using \"Edit\" and then \"Customize\" in the Notification Center. \r\nA proper iOS 14 style Moon widget is work in progress, stay tuned."
