message: "Actually, I'd like to be able to make alarms for any offset before a given hour.  For example, I like to have an alarm that goes off 30 minutes before sunset to remind me to do any last-minute outdoor chores.  (This can be done through Apple's alarm, but it's very cumbersome.) \r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for a great product.  I'm really enjoying it.  I took a course in Renaissance astrology in college and am enjoying greater awareness of what's going on in the heavens."
