message: "Ha, that’s material for a whole book! Too many possible combinations, right? This is how I would go about that… Since the Zodiac signs are ruled by the planets, we could single out few dominant planets and then build the astrological profile from there. Planetary energies give much clearer and more specific ideas. Once we have identified the most prominent planets (on the angles, number of aspects, detriment/exaltation, planetary hour, etc) then we can analyse how their zodiacal and house positions modify planetary energies. \r\nIf the 1st house is in Leo then it’s all about the abundance of the fire element. If there are some planets in the 1st then look how well they interact with fire. If none, then there’s still overall fiery disposition in the person.\r\nAgain, this is my approach, others may do it differently."
