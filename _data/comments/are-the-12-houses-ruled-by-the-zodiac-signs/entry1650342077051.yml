message: "Not everything that the ancients thought or practiced makes sense. Astrology is a developing discipline. The article doesn't attempt to look at the zodiac and the houses from a historical perspective. Instead, the focus is on the symbolic language and interconnectedness between different divisions of the sky.\r\n\r\nPerhaps your suggestion about the article's suggestion isn't really logical because I can't find an original suggestion you're putting under question. In the nutshell, the planets are the building blocks of the solar system and thus foundational to the chart. The zodiac and the houses display certain **relationship** to the planetary energies. That's what the article is about."
