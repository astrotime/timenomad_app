message: "The **Thema Mundi** is a good model to look into when researching the symbolism behind the planets and the zodiac. My general comment is that the thema corresponds to somewhat different nature of human consciousness of 2-3 thousand years ago with its strong emphasis on the Moon & Cancer (and their correspondence to tribe and family).\r\n\r\nFor better or worse, the modern world has moved to the Aries as \"I am\" â€“ the first sign and the first house. Experientially it makes more sense for our epoch so much focused on personal achievement and competition."
