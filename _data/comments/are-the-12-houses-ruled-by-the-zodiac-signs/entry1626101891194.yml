  Marcel, as a 8th House person I can assure you that even though affairs and
  sex are intimately related they also can be understood as different matters.
  If you try to look at things at a symbolical level you will find out that sex
  can represent lots of different things. Yes 8th house talks a lot about sex,
  and death (remember that orgasm is also known as little death), deep
  transformations, rebirth and the occult. If you don’t understand what the
  “occult” is, it is just because it still occult for most of people (otherwise
  it would be called the “obvious”). That is not “new age” stuff. Much to the
  contrary.
