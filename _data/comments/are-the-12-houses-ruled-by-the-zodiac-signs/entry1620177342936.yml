  I like so much that you’re talking about this! It is such a fun and
  interesting topic to explore. I personally chose to subscribe to the idea that
  the human lifespan can be illustrated in the Zodiac signs but not ascribing
  this to the houses. When I was first learning about the houses I read Deb
  Houdling’s The Houses: Temples of the Sky and I really liked her
  interpretation because she includes a historical account of the meaning of the
  houses and what has changed and what has stayed the same in mainstream
  interpretations throughout history. I highly recommend it for anyone
  interested in reading about this topic further. There is a lot of good info in
  there, her interpretation is that the houses and signs are not always so
  inherently aligned and she offers really good insight into that, in my
  opinion. If anyone has any similar recommended readings please share!!
