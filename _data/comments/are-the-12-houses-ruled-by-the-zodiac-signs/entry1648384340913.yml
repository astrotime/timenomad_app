  The ancient skywatchers who came up with astrology did not use houses; if
  anything, they used quadrants to indicate sunrise/sunset,
  midheaven/underworld, all indicating increase and decrease in
  visibility/strength. Houses are a mathematical calculation that is, iirc, an
  invention of the Hellenistic era, which came later. Some would assert that the
  most important thing about houses is their indication of how well each planet
  functions in the chart, based on the rulership scheme (so, pretty much the
  reverse of what you seem to suggest). Sidereal systems focus on the messages
  that originate in the heavens, beyond the plane of the planets (the moving
  stars), from the realm of the fixed stars. So the constellations (the origins
  of the signs) are emphasized as being meaningful in each planetary journey.
  I’m not making an argument, just pointing out some diffs with your thinking.
  Ultimately, as a divinatory system, it doesn’t much matter. The meanings will
  come across in whatever way they need to come across. The niggling over
  technique/theory doesn’t really change that, if one is honest. Thanks for the
  app!
