message: "5+8=13, 8+13=21, 13+21=34, 21+34=55…\r\n\r\nHe was adding the full numbers, but then only keeping the number in the “1”s space (the whole number farthest to the right), so for the numbers above: 3, 1, 4, 5…\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I’m not at all sure what that’s supposed to signify. There are plenty of ways to play with number the result in interesting patterns or sequences. Another classic example is the “3, 6, 9 pattern” that has become synonymous with Nikola Tesla and his “3/6/9 Math” aka “Vortex Based Mathmatics”. Tesla thought the secrets of the universe were contained within those numbers, with “9” representing “God”. A 2D representation of the patterns looks like a compass, or the Freemason’s logo, where the 3D representation looks like a toroidal sphere (or a “donut”), and is thought by some to be the “shape of everything” as it relates to energy flow - from the smallest (atoms) to the medium (planetary magnetic flow) to the largest (black holes, and the entire universe itself)."
