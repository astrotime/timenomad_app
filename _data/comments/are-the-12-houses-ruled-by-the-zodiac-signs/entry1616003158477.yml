  Thanks for the great article brother.  Another easy way to prove there are 12
  signs is using the 60 repeating golden ratio series which clearly shows the 12
  divisions, the cross, the Milky Way, swastika, circle of musical 5ths and so
  much more.  Just count in golden ratio (added the last two consecutive
  numbers) and only keep the 1â€™s column.  So
  0,1,1,2,3,5,8,3(13),1(21),4(34)5,9,4,3,7,0,7,7,4,1,5.... etc.  Wrap them
  around the zodiac and wow, look what you get... peace love and cheers!
