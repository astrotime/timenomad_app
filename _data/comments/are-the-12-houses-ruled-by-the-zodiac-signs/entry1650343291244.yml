message: "No conflation of the signs and the houses is present in the article. The article delves into the principles of temporal division of the astrological wheel. The question being answered is: how can one add a greater specificity to the chart? The answer is: using time (of the year and of the day) and the geographic location. Time and space are measurable units, that gives this system a solid foundation.\r\n\r\nThe four elements have been previously covered in [“The four Elements and their powers”](https://timenomad.app/posts/astrology/philosophy/2018/10/28/four-elements-and-their-powers.html) and [“How the four Elements rule over the Zodiac signs”](https://timenomad.app/posts/astrology/philosophy/2019/02/20/the-four-elements-rule-zodiac-signs.html). \r\n\r\nThe elements is a fascinating topic yet may be somewhat limiting from purely practical standpoint of interpreting astrological charts. On the contrary, the planetary energies (that are derivative of the elements) provide a more nuanced chart reading. For example, a fiery personality may be of fiery Mars or fiery Venus nature or inflamed Sun, etc. The power of the planetary energies is that they are “more humane” thus rendering themselves very well for psychological insights."
