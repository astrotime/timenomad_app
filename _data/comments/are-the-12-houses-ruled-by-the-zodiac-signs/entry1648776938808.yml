message: "Ummm…. Well…. I doubt the Cosmos are ruled by our planets…. becauuuuse, the cosmos make up the houses….  ummm…. But with the way modern astrology is taught, I can see how mankind would follow this way of thinking.\r\n\r\nHowever…. The “houses” are comprised of many MANY stars some bigget than our solar system…. Like the Triangulum…. Canis…. these houses share different moving constellations and likely many fixed… ya know?\r\n\r\nbut…. Earthlings, we like security in our knowings, right???  over everything…. so…. explaining that the houses rule constellations and that constellations rule planets seems weird to people.\r\n\r\nIn our class, we teach that the “rising” is the “sun” since where it is when you are born dictates your “ascending”…\r\n\r\nWe also teach that the Earth is ACTUALLY misnamed as the sun sign…. not only do we teach it, but we PROVE it.  With science as well as natal readings.\r\n\r\nThere has not been one soul who has not changed their line of thinking after being shown proof….  many who did NOT want to see it.\r\n\r\nI have like, a bunch of names in this app…. lol…. anyway…. This is the coolest app I have, and I am certain I have turned over 100 people on to this app.  This may not be the best arena to debate it, but I do not mind to explain some what…\r\n\r\nexcuse what comes off prideful…. just confident…. had to deal with many angry astrologers…. not really fair to blame me that I saw it from a different perspective before I agreed to everything I was taught about something I did not know ANYTHING about\U0001F64F\r\n\r\nBe blessed and thanks again for the app man…"
