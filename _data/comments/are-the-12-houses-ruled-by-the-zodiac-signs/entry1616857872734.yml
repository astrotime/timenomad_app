  Great, but you did not tell us, which rulership will be dominant in personal
  chart , when houses shifted.. letâ€™s say when first house (original qualities
  of Mars and Aries) actually falls in person chart in sign Leo (ruled by Sun) ,
  and so on! Which will dominate and how they interact (Sun-Mars rulers) who
  will have final word, how quality or actions will change? Etc. thanks
