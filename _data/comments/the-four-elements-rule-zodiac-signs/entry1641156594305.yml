message: "The reason the zodiac favors the northern hemisphere is simple. \r\n\r\nAll of India, all of China, the top half of Africa and the top third of South America are all above the equator ... thus historically 90% of humanity lived north of the equator and they could see the northern pole star ... but not the southern pole star region.  \r\n\r\nChina has four houses for the northern constellations and did not add a fifth house for the southern constellations until I believe the 11th century AD. \r\n\r\nAnother simple fact is that before the zodiac even existed the northern pole stars were revered. The northern pole star was the immovable center around which all other stars rotated ... UNTIL that fateful day somebody noticed that the immovable center moved and hence a new narrative was needed to account for what one day in the future would become precession of the equinoxes. \r\n\r\nThe shifting of the immovable center from the celestial axis to the ecliptic axis identified the ecliptic onto which the 12 signs of the zodiac are placed ...\r\n\r\nBut first you needed a POLE star as reference ... long long long before the zodiac was even considered by the imagination of man ... \r\n\r\ncheers"
