message: "Astrology belongs to the category of metaphysics, as opposed to the hard-fact science. Hence  all of astrological principles are of symbolical nature and thus don’t have 100% translation into the physical reality. \r\n\r\nDiscovery of the Zodiac happened in the Northern Hemisphere where the obvious fact of having four seasons and transitions between them was a great help to establish the four elements and cyclical relationship between them. \r\n\r\nAstrology is the study of time where different periods bring forward different qualitative experiences. For obvious physical reasons the Norther Hemisphere reflects those principles in a direct inconspicuous manner as opposed to the tropical equatorial regions. The Southern Hemisphere simply didn’t have landmass that was populated enough.\r\n\r\nThe Zodiac represents the archetypal cosmic movement that is more evident in the Northern Hemisphere. So it got noticed and formalised that way. The Four Elements is an elegant model and so far hasn’t seen a more compleling alternative, but that may change in future, who knows!"
