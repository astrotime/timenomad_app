message: "Hi\r\nA very interesting article but how does it work for the southern hemisphere and tropics? Astrologers seem to forget or dismiss the reality of the southern hemisphere south of Tropic of Caprocorn  and at the tropics between Cancer and Capricorn where seasons don't really exist.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJames"
