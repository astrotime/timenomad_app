message: "Great article, thankyou for your insights. I enjoy the depth to which you explore these topics. \r\n\r\nI found it interesting to observe that, when regarding the triplicities and the 4 \"ending\" signs (Sagittarius, Cap, Aquarius, Pisces,) the two signs which are sandwiched in the middle of this \"matured\" section of the Zodiacal wheel are Capricorn and Aquarius. This seems fitting when considering the Saturnian traits the two signs take on from their Ruler.\r\n(Its also intriguing to notice how Aquarius-Capricorn is positioned opposite Cancer-Leo on the line of duality you've shown in this article) \r\n \r\nEqually, I envision Sagittarius and Pisces, being ruled by equally wise Jupiter, taking on more of a youthful and outgoing air of the \"beginning\" and \"staying\" energies of their neighbours Aries, and Scorpio. This seems to correspond with Jupiter's archetype nicely. \r\n\r\nJust some musings I wanted to share after reading this article! \r\nThanks again!"
