  Progressing forward in time, the tropical-sidereal mismatch could be seen as a
  metaphor for the human consciousness gradually moving away from mother Earth
  to the domain of the solar system and its starry neighbourhood. There is
  little doubt that a lot is going to change once the humanity makes its
  unavoidable move to the space and we will become interplanetary species. There
  will be no usual seasons and some new reference points are likely to be
  introduced – since the vernal equinox is hardwired into the Sun-Earth
  relationship – yet the zodiac constellations will remain as fixed reference
  points in the “sky”. Due to the physics and economics of space flight the
  majority of human activity is more likely to take place around the ecliptic
  plane. The constellation-based zodiac may become a predominant system for
  astrological measurements and interpretations.
