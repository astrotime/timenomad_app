message: "The key word here is “affinity”. For example, if one looks at the [sequence of planetary spheres](https://timenomad.app/posts/astrology/philosophy/2018/11/23/what-is-planetary-hours-part-one.html), the sphere of Jupiter is in the sixth sphere when counting from the sphere of the Moon upwards.\r\n\r\nAlso, Jupiter relates to number 12 which is roughly the number of years it takes the planet to complete the Zodiac (~1 year per sign). This doesn't give a strict formula but there's an intuitive sense that Jupiter is somehow related to the number 6 – more than any other planet. By working with astrological charts, one learns to get a feeling of the Jupiter's influence when it comes to sextiles."
