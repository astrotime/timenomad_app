  The Golden Ratio triangle is 36deg-108deg-36deg.  This is the a triangle of
  1-phi-1.  The decile and tridecile is something that would be very beneficial
  as this would help in predicting weather.  Would love it if you could make
  those aspects available.  thanks for all the excellent work you do brother! 
  p.s. I still have not gone through your email :-)
