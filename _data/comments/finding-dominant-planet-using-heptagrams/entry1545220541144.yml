  I think asymmetrical heptagrams aren’t bad, they highlight a different
  composition of astral energies. Asymmetricals often more jazzier so to speak.
  Plus it’s not like “mine” or “theirs” heptagram. Heptagram shows a cosmic
  configuration that perhaps influenced a balance of personal chart but it’s not
  a personal thing.
