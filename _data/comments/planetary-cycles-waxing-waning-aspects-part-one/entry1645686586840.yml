message: "Hello Stephen, sorry about your son in law. I think it could be pluto especially if it’s the chart ruler or angle ruler in his chart. I have pluto conjunct my Scorpio Asc from the 12 (about 5degrees) and when it was at 6 Capricorn, second house opposite my sun in 8th exact, I had spine issues that last almost a year. Everyone thought I was going to die. My life hasn’t been the same after that! That was in 2009(I think) I’m just now coming into my new self. Yeah it’s taken me over a decade, but that was where my present chaotic journey started.\r\n\r\nRemember Capricorn rules the spine and bones. So with pluto transit in hard aspect to sun, chances are vitality (sun) will be challenged in some way."
