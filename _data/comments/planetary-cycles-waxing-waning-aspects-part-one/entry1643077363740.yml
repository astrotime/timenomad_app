message: "The tricky thing about Pluto is that it's a very slow planet. It takes 248 years to complete a rotation along the zodiac, Pluto spends an approximate of 20 years in each sign. My guess is that Pluto isn't the main culprit in your son-in-law case. It can certainly exacerbate things but there's something else as well. \r\n\r\nPluto transits are so long term that most of Earth's population would be suffering enormously if Pluto transits had a major influence through its transits. Yet that's clearly not the case. Pluto sets long term trends, things like power, money, politics, destiny of nations, etc. It's a big subterranean force that works through gradual tectonic movements."
