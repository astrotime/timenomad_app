message: "Pluto in Capricorn has been transiting my son-in-law's Sun in 25 degrees Capricorn since his Pluto-Sun conjunction in May 2020. This back and forth continued in 2021 for 3 more exact conjunctions of Pluto-Sun.  The conjunction will still be in an orb of 3 degrees into late 2022 until moving toward Pluto in Aquarius.\r\nThe nearly 4 year effect on him has been enormous from a C5 neck problem to marital difficulties and this will continue through most of 2022. \r\nCan we attest this to the Pluto transits and what are such frequent transit conjunction trying to say?"
