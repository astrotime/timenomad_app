message: "Thanks for this article. It is edifying that you mention Libra and Aries representing the spring impulses in BOTH hemispheres. And that the Solstices mark the return of the impulse of night in BOTH hemispheres. Many Astrologers are 'Temperate Zone Northern Hemisphere' centric as I call it (even southern hemisphere Astrologers like Santos Bonacci) and ignore or dismiss other seasonal realities at the north pole, the equator and southern hemisphere. Such ignorance or dogmatic stances do not help in the quest to make Astrology a universal science. \r\n\r\nI like how you say it's not all set in stone. True  science is empirical and adaptable to new discoveries, preserves relevant truths and does not throw out past findings, e.g. the truth that it is still spring at 0 degrees Aries in the northern hemisphere despite the discovery that it is the beginning of autumn in the southern hemisphere, does not invalidate Astrology as some claim it does. Having said that, if Tropical Astrology continues to correlate  the seasons with signs then should  the rulership and dignity of the planets in signs be changed for those born in the southern hemisphere, e.g. Mars rule Libra with Sun exalted therein ? Alternatively we could discontinue correlating the signs to seasons but rather correlate them to the 'direction' of the planets along the ecliptic, as Vic David Cara states? So, In its apparent annual path as seen from the whole planet, the sun rises due East at 0 degrees Aries, and is therefore exalted  in that sign for the entire planet, reaches its most northern point at 0 degrees Cancer, sets due West at 0 degrees Libra and is at its most southern point at 0 degrees Capricorn. From anywhere on earth the sun doesn't appear to move in the opposite direction annually, i.e. rise due East at 0 degrees Aries, culminate at 0 degrees Capricorn and set at 0 degrees Libra.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, given the discovery by tropical astrologers that the northern hemisphere seasons are not universal,  there was ancient unconscious wisdom in alternating the masculine/feminine and diurnal/nocturnal signs. If Scorpio to Pisces had been deemed nocturnal (reflecting darker days in northern hemisphere) as Rudolf Steiner designates them, for example,  and Aries to Libra had been deemed diurnal (reflecting lighter days) then this Tropical model described above may not have been applicable in the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate your thoughts on this.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJames"
