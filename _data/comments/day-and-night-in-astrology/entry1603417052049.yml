message: "Much appreciate your thoughtful comment! \r\n\r\nHaving lived in the northern and in the southern hemisphere for extended periods of time, I am acutely aware of the differences and seasonal variations. Hence my ongoing effort to see the picture from the both sides of the equator. The experiential aspect is also of a great importance to me, for example the night sky of the southern hemisphere feels very different from the northern hemisphere. The zodiac is the same yet the polar regions add certain hues that modulate it in unique ways. Can this be formalised? I don’t know.\r\n\r\nIn my personal view astrology deals with an archetypal symbolism, how things from above reflect down here. Thus when dealing with he zodiac one deals with a projection of core “pure” principles that aren’t necessarily linked to the season but rather to the notion of a cycle of changes. I think the Chinese principle of Wuxing that deals with the notion of “movement” is a great way to formalise cycles that can be cosmic, seasonal, health-, politics-, etc. related.\r\n\r\nAnother way is Plato’s theory of forms. The leads to the idea that each zodiacal sign corresponds to a specific archetype that exists independent of the Earth’s physics and optics. This could mean that it’s not the geography or timing defines qualities of the zodiac signs. It’s the “pure” signs that pass their true cosmic essence through the framework of the Earth’s reference point. This clearly causes certain variations and perceived inconsistencies… yet the nature of the signs is still the same, and will remain the same even on other planets of the solar system. Yet there will always location-dependent tinting.\r\n\r\nThe northern hemisphere had a geographic “privilege” that the cosmic principles less inconspicuous (and also slightly less tinted) so astrology was formalised there. Plus some 2,000 years ago the tropical zodiac and the constellations were aligned and that coincidence helped even further!"
