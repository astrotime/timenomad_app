message: "Venus–Mars aspects manifest themselves differently depending on at least three factors: aspect, house and sign (in this order of strength). Conjunction produces stronger more uniform libido and creative potential, supported by their Leo position; the 7th house speaks “relationships and partnerships” – I see this as a favourable layout provided no other planets introduce malefic influences via their aspects (ie, check Pluto and Saturn). \r\n\r\nI’ve often seen that people with Venus–Mars aspects tend to be attracted to each other, and it makes sense since both planets give an affinity to passion and creativity.\r\n\r\nYet it’s important to observe that Venus–Mars is not a uniform “profile” — it can manifest rather differently depending on their location and “season” of life. Situation changes and person changes, their energy adapts to the reality."
