message: "What will this mean for the natal squares and then for the natal Conjunctions??\r\n\r\nI have them Conjunct Leo 7th. And my bestie has it squared V. Pisces & M. Sag and then her partner has it V. Leo sq M. Gemini —— and my boyfriend is born 10 days after me. Same Conjunction. I ask because I have been trying to research those two planets, in relationships and in relationship to Pluto Libra generation"
