Amazing app. (Follow-up Review)","text":"Look no further, get this app. If you are a serious astrology student, this is the app you need. \n\nThis is a follow-up to my 1st review that Apple did not let me access. \n\nMy 1st review had 3 stars, this is an upgrade. It isn't that something goes wrong that makes an app; something WILL go wrong--it is the nature of software. It is WHAT HAPPENS when it goes wrong that makes the app, and this developer is top shelf.\n\n------------------------------------\nApple strikes again! \nApp Store not able to recognize me while logged in; and hides new reviews miles down in the list. \n\nI wrote a review, downgraded the star rating after paid part of app broke; and wanted to upgrade it again. If I can ever find that review again I will edit it, Time Nomad deserves a SOLID five stars.\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis app is epic. Serious, albeit beginning astrology student here. This app is better than many costing $30 and up! It does require an internet connection; but the bonus is that you get very precise coordinates, and the app takes up less space on your phone, and will run a lot faster as the bulk of the work takes place on the server.\n\nIt is fast, flawless, feature-packed and comes with a great help system which is activated by clicking on the various elements such as f. example transits. \n\nThe paid progression broke; but--this gal is an old geek, been using computers since the -80's and let me tell you; personal service like this is exceptional, and in 2018, downright unheard of. The developer personally answered my query and spent time troubleshooting my issue via e-mail. Color me IMPRESSED! While the part still isn't functional; the rest of the app still is, and I am 100% convinced it will be taken care of. \n\nI have therefore scrapped my plans of buying another program, and instead plan on springing for the asteroid package to make it a complete solution. \n\nI'd give Time Nomad six stars if I could. \n\nThank you Denis!! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1092841332&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2830213212","userName":"Iustin.22","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id801380832","version":"2.5.3","score":5,"title":"This App does a Stellar Job","text":"This App is perfect for advanced astrologists.

And, extremely helpful for the beginner because of it's ease of use. I can't believe it's free and agree with other reviewers that a Donate Button should be added. \nThe Personal Events window layout is pure gold for me but there are many other incredibly useful features displayed in an elegant, easy to read manner. Data entry is easy, the GPS for location is incredibly accurate and there is a huge database of places in the built-in atlas. There is even a handy Widget that can be accessed from the lock screen and you can set the app to notify you at midnight of the upcoming day's transits to your chart!! The Developer is very responsive to feedback and I thank him for adding the two more House systems that I suggested in a previous review.\n\nSome humble requests for future updates. Dennis, this is just my wishful thinking rather than any criticism of the wonderful job you've done! I'm lazy and only want to have to open one app üòâ\nI have every good iOS Astrology app available, including Vedic ones and this the one I use every day, along with iPhemeris Astrology. And, if there was an ephemeris feature, I wouldn't bother with the latter. At the very least, a list of the current planetary degrees would be great. Even better would be an ephemeris for the past, current and following month.\nEven the wheels, which are huge, don't display the degrees of the planets, though there's plenty of room to do so. The symbols of the planets are also disproportionately tiny compared to the size of the wheels. I understand this is to emphasize the aspects in the wheel. Personally, I don't need aspects drawn in. Perhaps offering two options of Wheel layout could be implemented? One as it is now and a second one with aspect lines turned off so that other information can be displayed in the wheel. Such as larger sign and planetary glyphs and their degrees. Even Nakshatras and/or Decanates could be included in such a layout!\nSome further ability to customize the display would also be great.  I want to be able to choose whether aspects to the Asc, MC, Nodes etc. are listed or not. And, if possible, it would be great to include Novile and Septile aspects. These are based on the numbers 9 & 7 which, arguably, are more important than Quintiles (based on 5). \n  If an ephemeris feature was added then, being able to customize the Ayanamsha by entering our own for the year 2000 or, inputting an offset to Lahiri would be wonderful. This would make the app usable by many western Sidereal astrologers (who use Fagan, Babylonian or Galactic center) as well as more Vedic ones astrologers also. \nThank again, Dennis, for what is obviously a labor of love for you but, also incredibly useful for us all.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1092841332&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1674518143","userName":"carrifaery","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id424777269","version":"1.6","score":5,"title":"Baller","text":"Omg thank heavens for this app. Astrologer gangster approved.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1092841332&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1648069425","userName":"AltGrendel","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id278545360","version":"1.6","score":4,"title":"Really good app","text":"Handy for interpretation for the most part.
