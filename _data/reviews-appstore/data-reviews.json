Amazing app. (Follow-up Review)","text":"Look no further, get this app. If you are a serious astrology student, this is the app you need. \n\nThis is a follow-up to my 1st review that Apple did not let me access. \n\nMy 1st review had 3 stars, this is an upgrade. It isn't that something goes wrong that makes an app; something WILL go wrong--it is the nature of software. It is WHAT HAPPENS when it goes wrong that makes the app, and this developer is top shelf.\n\n------------------------------------\nApple strikes again! \nApp Store not able to recognize me while logged in; and hides new reviews miles down in the list. \n\nI wrote a review, downgraded the star rating after paid part of app broke; and wanted to upgrade it again. If I can ever find that review again I will edit it, Time Nomad deserves a SOLID five stars.\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis app is epic. Serious, albeit beginning astrology student here. This app is better than many costing $30 and up! It does require an internet connection; but the bonus is that you get very precise coordinates, and the app takes up less space on your phone, and will run a lot faster as the bulk of the work takes place on the server.\n\nIt is fast, flawless, feature-packed and comes with a great help system which is activated by clicking on the various elements such as f. example transits. \n\nThe paid progression broke; but--this gal is an old geek, been using computers since the -80's and let me tell you; personal service like this is exceptional, and in 2018, downright unheard of. The developer personally answered my query and spent time troubleshooting my issue via e-mail. Color me IMPRESSED! While the part still isn't functional; the rest of the app still is, and I am 100% convinced it will be taken care of. \n\nI have therefore scrapped my plans of buying another program, and instead plan on springing for the asteroid package to make it a complete solution. \n\nI'd give Time Nomad six stars if I could. \n\nThank you Denis!! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç","country":"USA"},{"id":"2807793381","userName":"swblank10","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id101278765","version":"2.5.3","score":5,"title":"Awesome!","text":"Thank you for developing this awesome app and continuing to add new features, I‚Äôm really grateful!","country":"USA"},{"id":"2750655033","userName":"Whyismynametakennoo","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id492621631","version":"2.5.3","score":5,"title":"Impressed","text":"There's a lot of detail in a decent UI\nIs there a way to set a specific screen as the default/home/one the app opens with?
