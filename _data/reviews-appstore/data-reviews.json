But even after doing that, the list is HUGE. This is fine, BUT it could be better\n\nI think a great update would be to add the option where we can create folders, rather than one huge list, so the user can make one folder titled family where they keep their family members, one titled friends where they keep their friends. More realistically in my case, I can make a folder for one time killers, one for serial killers, and (because I‚Äôm not a COMPLETE freak) one for authors, one for actors, one for musicians, etc. \n\nOn another note, I really want the add ons...but $8 for 9 planetary bodies/asteroids is kind of steep, esp considering everything else is $4.

If you added more options to that add on, I‚Äôd buy it in a heartbeat. \n\nAlternatively, I think an option to buy the whole set for $20-25 (rather than $28 when buying them individually) would really push people to buying the whole set of add ons \n\nI love the app, and it‚Äôs a phenomenal resource to this rookie astrologer.

Amazing app. (Follow-up Review)","text":"Look no further, get this app. If you are a serious astrology student, this is the app you need. \n\nThis is a follow-up to my 1st review that Apple did not let me access. \n\nMy 1st review had 3 stars, this is an upgrade. It isn't that something goes wrong that makes an app; something WILL go wrong--it is the nature of software. It is WHAT HAPPENS when it goes wrong that makes the app, and this developer is top shelf.\n\n------------------------------------\nApple strikes again! \nApp Store not able to recognize me while logged in; and hides new reviews miles down in the list. \n\nI wrote a review, downgraded the star rating after paid part of app broke; and wanted to upgrade it again. If I can ever find that review again I will edit it, Time Nomad deserves a SOLID five stars.\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis app is epic. Serious, albeit beginning astrology student here. This app is better than many costing $30 and up! It does require an internet connection; but the bonus is that you get very precise coordinates, and the app takes up less space on your phone, and will run a lot faster as the bulk of the work takes place on the server.\n\nIt is fast, flawless, feature-packed and comes with a great help system which is activated by clicking on the various elements such as f. example transits. \n\nThe paid progression broke; but--this gal is an old geek, been using computers since the -80's and let me tell you; personal service like this is exceptional, and in 2018, downright unheard of. The developer personally answered my query and spent time troubleshooting my issue via e-mail. Color me IMPRESSED! While the part still isn't functional; the rest of the app still is, and I am 100% convinced it will be taken care of. \n\nI have therefore scrapped my plans of buying another program, and instead plan on springing for the asteroid package to make it a complete solution. \n\nI'd give Time Nomad six stars if I could. \n\nThank you Denis!! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç","country":"USA"},{"id":"2830213212","userName":"Iustin.22","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id801380832","version":"2.5.3","score":5,"title":"This App does a Stellar Job","text":"This App is perfect for advanced astrologists.
