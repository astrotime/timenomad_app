Put all fonts in BLACK ink against a WHITE background.

It isn't that something goes wrong that makes an app; something WILL go wrong--it is the nature of software. It is WHAT HAPPENS when it goes wrong that makes the app, and this developer is top shelf.\n\n------------------------------------\nApple strikes again! \nApp Store not able to recognize me while logged in; and hides new reviews miles down in the list. \n\nI wrote a review, downgraded the star rating after paid part of app broke; and wanted to upgrade it again. If I can ever find that review again I will edit it, Time Nomad deserves a SOLID five stars.\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis app is epic. Serious, albeit beginning astrology student here. This app is better than many costing $30 and up! It does require an internet connection; but the bonus is that you get very precise coordinates, and the app takes up less space on your phone, and will run a lot faster as the bulk of the work takes place on the server.\n\nIt is fast, flawless, feature-packed and comes with a great help system which is activated by clicking on the various elements such as f. example transits. \n\nThe paid progression broke; but--this gal is an old geek, been using computers since the -80's and let me tell you; personal service like this is exceptional, and in 2018, downright unheard of. The developer personally answered my query and spent time troubleshooting my issue via e-mail. Color me IMPRESSED! While the part still isn't functional; the rest of the app still is, and I am 100% convinced it will be taken care of. \n\nI have therefore scrapped my plans of buying another program, and instead plan on springing for the asteroid package to make it a complete solution. \n\nI'd give Time Nomad six stars if I could. \n\nThank you Denis!! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç","country":"USA"},{"id":"2830213212","userName":"Iustin.22","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id801380832","version":"2.5.3","score":5,"title":"This App does a Stellar Job","text":"This App is perfect for advanced astrologists.
