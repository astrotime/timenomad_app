It is the only app I’ve ever seen with a Transit Timeline, or Transit Graphs, and I love the feature that allows me to select a transit and then click through to see when it began, when it’s exact, and when it ends. \n\nThe only way it could be improved is if they hired people to write descriptions of each aspect, placement, and transit. However, this is a feature of many other apps and sites, so I *can* get that information elsewhere. I consider this the best free app out there for astrology, and it satisfies the geek in me.

The only thing is, there’s so many of them that my people list became too cluttered that I couldn’t find my family/friends, so I moved the killers all to the company list. But even after doing that, the list is HUGE. This is fine, BUT it could be better\n\nI think a great update would be to add the option where we can create folders, rather than one huge list, so the user can make one folder titled family where they keep their family members, one titled friends where they keep their friends. More realistically in my case, I can make a folder for one time killers, one for serial killers, and (because I’m not a COMPLETE freak) one for authors, one for actors, one for musicians, etc. \n\nOn another note, I really want the add ons...but $8 for 9 planetary bodies/asteroids is kind of steep, esp considering everything else is $4. Obviously you guys wanna make your dough, but I feel like $8 isn’t worth it for only 9 extras. If you added more options to that add on, I’d buy it in a heartbeat. \n\nAlternatively, I think an option to buy the whole set for $20-25 (rather than $28 when buying them individually) would really push people to buying the whole set of add ons \n\nI love the app, and it’s a phenomenal resource to this rookie astrologer.

I’m under the impression this app is more for the  individual that has an extensive knowledge on astrology. So, the issue I have will not be a problem for  someone who uses this app because they already have an understanding of aspects and house placement, so they don’t need to be explain as much what  Moon and Pluto aspect is. But if your a beginner forget about it because you will be completely lost with the all the information that is being thrown at you. Not saying that the app doesn’t provide information of astrology  because it does but is more basic is not as descriptive as I will like.

It’s worth it even though I’m submitting feedback for developers. \n\nFEEDBACK FOR DEVELOPMENT:\n- There’s a bug where the wrong forecasting date is shown at the top when looking at future or past transits to the natal chart, and sometimes when you’re viewing the natal chat +/- time\n- I use this app to catalog charts so being able to group them or rearrange the order they appear on the left would be super helpful.\n- Editing birth data or deleting a chart is not intuitive from a UX perspective since you have to click the add button (edit library > select person).

It isn't that something goes wrong that makes an app; something WILL go wrong--it is the nature of software. It is WHAT HAPPENS when it goes wrong that makes the app, and this developer is top shelf.\n\n------------------------------------\nApple strikes again! \nApp Store not able to recognize me while logged in; and hides new reviews miles down in the list. \n\nI wrote a review, downgraded the star rating after paid part of app broke; and wanted to upgrade it again. If I can ever find that review again I will edit it, Time Nomad deserves a SOLID five stars.\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis app is epic. Serious, albeit beginning astrology student here. This app is better than many costing $30 and up! It does require an internet connection; but the bonus is that you get very precise coordinates, and the app takes up less space on your phone, and will run a lot faster as the bulk of the work takes place on the server.\n\nIt is fast, flawless, feature-packed and comes with a great help system which is activated by clicking on the various elements such as f. example transits. \n\nThe paid progression broke; but--this gal is an old geek, been using computers since the -80's and let me tell you; personal service like this is exceptional, and in 2018, downright unheard of. The developer personally answered my query and spent time troubleshooting my issue via e-mail. Color me IMPRESSED! While the part still isn't functional; the rest of the app still is, and I am 100% convinced it will be taken care of. \n\nI have therefore scrapped my plans of buying another program, and instead plan on springing for the asteroid package to make it a complete solution. \n\nI'd give Time Nomad six stars if I could. \n\nThank you Denis!! ☺️👍","country":"USA"},{"id":"2807793381","userName":"swblank10","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id101278765","version":"2.5.3","score":5,"title":"Awesome!","text":"Thank you for developing this awesome app and continuing to add new features, I’m really grateful!","country":"USA"},{"id":"2750655033","userName":"Whyismynametakennoo","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id492621631","version":"2.5.3","score":5,"title":"Impressed","text":"There's a lot of detail in a decent UI\nIs there a way to set a specific screen as the default/home/one the app opens with?

The developers put a lot of work into this clean, ad free app. It's worth giving it a try.\n\nEDIT: After using this regularly for a few weeks I really like the aspects time line.

Perhaps it is a work in progress yet as it is gives the user much flexibility and reliability, a rather unique work and research environment. It leans more towards research and does not provide much in the area of interpretation of this or that aspect, sign, planet or placement, which I for one very much prefer. It does not replace my astrological tools, but certainly complements them with distinction. I sincerely hope it will remain a work in progress.
