I use it to keep an eye on transits but have paid the nominal amount for progressions too. My only negative point is that it doesn‚Äôt offer Solar charts but for the basics for a novice astrology person like me this a good day to day, easy to use app. It‚Äôs free so why not give it a go?","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/review?id=1092841332&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3069498954","userName":"Kompozitk@","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/reviews/id451934730","version":"2.7","score":5,"title":"Amazing!","text":"This application is absolutely incredible!

Perhaps one of the most feature full apps I have come across, and they're all really useful. This is a real achievement indeed. \n\nThe one featured that would make this application even better would be if it was possible to see the planetary degree's on the chart. This would make analysis much faster without having to tap on the chart.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/review?id=1092841332&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1624186340","userName":"Haris Liviu","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/reviews/id136312123","version":"1.6","score":5,"title":"Wow!
