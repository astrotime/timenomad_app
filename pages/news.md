<h1 class="post-title p-name" itemprop="name headline" style="margin-top: 30px;">Astrology Today</h1>

_Astrology Today_ is a bi-weekly **newsletter** published by the creator of the [Time Nomad app](/). The main points of difference:

* Covers current and upcoming **astrological events**.
* Offers no-nonsence and **jargon-free explanations**.
* Aims to make **you learn something new** each time.
* Balanced to be **entertaining** vs academic sounding.

Simply put, the newsletter is not trying to behave like a  clever and hard-to-understand-expert astrologer. It doesn’t use exotic words and terms that only few incumbents understand. The newsletter is a down-to-earth source of astrological news and knowledge for the rest of us — without being simplistic or shallow.

> _Astrology Today_ strives to **provide value** to each of its readers!

[Subscribe to the newsletter](#mc_embed_signup) (don’t forget to <span style="color: red;">periodically check your junk</span> folder, sometimes the initial issue lands there) and receive fresh astrological updates on what is happening in the sky and extend your astrological knowledge — a great and entertaining way to **learn a bit more with each issue**.
