---

Welcome to the app’s features overview. You can use this page as a quick “cheat sheet” that can quickly take you through all major astrological functions of Time Nomad. This way you will be able to see the bigger picture of what you can achieve using the app.

Each feature offers a “read more” link that will take you to a detailed explanation of the functionality behind each feature.


## Screen layout

---

Time Nomad screen cosists of three areas. The iPad version below is shown for simplicity. The iPhone version is pretty much the same, the only difference being collapsed left and right panels.

![Time Nomad astrology app screen layout](/images/features/time-nomad-features-screen-layout.png "Time Nomad app screen layout")

<div class="clearfix"></div>

* **Left panel** – create, select and edit profiles. 
* **Right panel** – select an astrological report.
* **Middle panel** – shows the view for selected action.



## Creating and editing profiles

---

Top left corner “plus” button brings up a profile creation menu.

![Time Nomad menu to create astrological personal profile](/images/features/time-nomad-features-profile-menu.png "Astrological profile menu")

This menu allows:

* **Create** new profile
* **Edit** profile library, including:
	* **Rearrange** profiles
	* **Delete** profiles



## Configuring Time Nomad to your preferences

---

Next top left corner menu is the “cogwheel” settings menu. Make sure you use it to configure how you want Time Nomad to present astrological information.

![Time Nomad application settings menu](/images/features/time-nomad-features-settings-menu.png "Application settings menu")

In particular:

* Planets you're interested in
* House system
* Aspects
* Orbs for aspects, transits and progressions
* and other settings

Additionally, here you configure how widgets and notifications present themselves.


## Astrological chart for now

---

One of the most used actions that show the chart for the person at their current geographical location.

![Time Nomad astrological chart for today](/images/features/time-nomad-features-chart.png "Astrological chart for today")

The default chart view may not be how you want it. Use the "Show" button in the bottom left corner of the screen. 

![Time Nomad astrological chart configuration](/images/features/time-nomad-features-chart-configure.png "Configuring astrological chart for today")

<div class="clearfix"></div>

Pretty much **every screen** of Time Nomad has its own "Show" button that allows to fine-tune its presentation. Time Nomad will remember settings that you made for each screen and each person.

`Pro tip: Explore the Show menu on each screen!`


## Moving through time

---

Time adjustment slider allows for quick exploration of astrological phenomena through time.

![Time Nomad time adjustement](/images/features/time-nomad-features-time-navigation-1.png "Time adjustment slider")

Two ways to operate:
* **Drag** the handle
* **Tap left/right** of the handle for incremental movement

<div class="clearfix"></div>

If specific date and time is required, use "Date" button in the bottom right corner of pretty much every screen.

![Time Nomad date and time adjustement](/images/features/time-nomad-features-time-navigation-2.png "Date adjustment overlay")

Two ways to operate:

* **Go to Selected Date & Time** – will "lock" the app time at the given moment
* **Follow Current Date & Time** - will "unlock" the app time and it will continue ticking along with current time

![Time Nomad time stopped](/images/features/time-nomad-features-time-navigation-3.png "Time is locked")

<div class="clearfix"></div>

In **Go to Selected Date & Time** mode the app time will remain locked to specified moment and will not start following current time until **Follow Current Date & Time** has been tapped.

`Tip: Don't get stuck in time! Make sure "Follow Current Date & Time" is your current mode.`


## Numerical chart details

---

One of nice features of Time Nomad is "tap on the date" that brings up a numerical chart data popup. This works on every screen where the date is displayed at the top.

![Time Nomad numerical details of astrological chart](/images/features/time-nomad-features-numerical-chart-details.png "Numerical details popup")

Nothing beats a good overview of current numbers! Both tropical and sidereal Zodiac report is supported.

Lots of information presented in a compact way, ie:

* Geographic coordinates of location
* Local time and time zone
* UTC time
* Julian day
* Hour angle
* Sun/Moon phases
* Planetary hour
* Ayanamsa
* Ecliptic and heliocentric coordinates of planets
* Parallels and contra-paralles with declinations of planets
* Planets in houses
* Dignities
* Triplicities
* Quadruplicities
* Mutual receptions


## Real-time dashboard

---

The dashboard contains a plethora of current information, from both global and personal standpoints. Current events clearly highlighted.

![Time Nomad astrological and astronomical dashboard](/images/features/time-nomad-features-dashboard.png "Dashboard view of Time Nomad")

Global events components:

* Solar cycle – equinoxes and solstices
* Lunar cycle – phases of the Moon
* Solar-lunar arc
* Moon Void of Course
* Lunar days
* Retrograde planets

Personal components:

* Solar and lunar returns
* Solar-lunar arc
* Most interesting transits


## Tap to learn

---

Time Nomad provides with the **foundational astrological knowledge**, the app doesn’t intend to answer the "what does it mean for me" question, leaving this function to the interpreter’s skills. Yet the app provides a good amount of supporting astrological and astronomical information for pretty much every view that allows for insights and reflections to emerge.

![Time Nomad planet in zodiac sign](/images/features/time-nomad-features-tap-to-learn-1.png "Planet crossing Zodiac sign cusp")

Almost every screen element can be tapped to reveal its symbolism, mythological and physical components.

## Global and personal events forecast

---

Time Nomad looks ahead and compiles a summary of what to expect in the coming days. 

![Time Nomad upcoming events](/images/features/time-nomad-features-events-summary.png "Upcoming events")

The **Summary view** shows punctual events in text format.

![Time Nomad timeline of upcoming events](/images/features/time-nomad-features-events-timeline.png "Timeline of upcoming events")

<div class="clearfix"></div>

Two timeline views – **World Events** and **Personal Events** – show unfoldment of astrological aspects and transits through time.


![Time Nomad events notifications](/images/features/time-nomad-features-events-notifications.png "Notification about today's events")

Turn on **astrological events notifications** by using the “Notify” button in the bottom right corner. Notifications arrive at the beginning of each day and are specific to that day.

There are two types of notifications:
* **World events**, like phases of the Moon, aspects, etc.
* **Personal events**, like transits, solar return, solar-lunar arc, etc.

Personal events can be switched on for more than one profile, meaning you will be receiving separate daily reports for each person. As always, the “Show” button allows you to configure which events to deliver, for example you may not be interested in certain aspects or would like to receive sidereal Zodiac events, or even both tropical and sidereal.


## Widget for Notifications Center

---

Time Nomad comes with the **Chart of Today** widget that can be activated in iOS Notification Center and allows you to see the current chart `right on your home screen, without opening the app`.

![Time Nomad iOS notification center astrological chart of today widget](/images/features/time-nomad-features-widget-chart.png "iOS notification center widget")

The widget shows:

* Phases of the Moon cycle
* Personal solar-lunar arc cycle (if activated in the app settings)
* Chart for today

Tap on "Show more" or "Show less" to switch between the modes.


## Exploring chart in details

---

Several additional screens help to dig deeper into the current chart.

![Time Nomad astrological chart details](/images/features/time-nomad-features-chart-details.png "Details of astrological chart")

**Chart Details** screen shows:
* Planets in Zodiac
* Planets in houses
* Parallels and contra-parallels

![Time Nomad list of astrological aspects](/images/features/time-nomad-features-chart-aspects.png "List of astrological chart aspects")

<div class="clearfix"></div>

**Aspects List** screen allows to group aspects by body or aspects. Each aspect shows an orb and indicates if it’s an approaching or separating aspect.

![Time Nomad timeline of astrological aspects](/images/features/time-nomad-features-chart-aspects-timeline.png "Timeline of astrological chart aspects")

Even though each aspect culminates at a specific moment in time, it’s hardly always punctual event. Gradual unfoldment of each aspect through time is shown by **Aspects Timeline** screen. This report allows you to see how long does it take for the aspect to reach its full strength.

![Time Nomad view of the solar system](/images/features/time-nomad-features-solar-system.png "View of the solar system")

<div class="clearfix"></div>

**Solar System** view may offer a few additional insights into the planetary configuration. For example, it’s easy to see superior and inferior aspect – notice that the illustration shows Mercury and the Sun conjunct, specifically forming an inferior conjunction since Mercury (inferior planet) is in front of the Sun.


## Planetary hour calculator

**Planetary Hour**, a tool in its own right, allows to explore the rhythm of planetary hours throughout the day. Planetary hour calculator provides precise planetary hours data for any date and location on Earth.

![Time Nomad planetary hour calculator watch face](/images/features/time-nomad-features-planetary-hour-calculator.png "Planetary hour calculator watch face")

Use the scroller to access:
* planetary hour alarm
* watch face
* list of hours for current day
* heptagrams

![Time Nomad planetary hour calculator list view](/images/features/time-nomad-features-planetary-hour-calculator-list.png "Planetary hour calculator list view")

Planetary hour calculator also offers two **heptagram views** — one based on the sequence of days of the week, another is based on the sequence of planetary hours. Heptagrams is a powerful tool that tells about the qualities of time at a specific moment.

![Time Nomad planetary hour calculator heptagram ordered by weekdays](/images/features/time-nomad-features-planetary-hour-calculator-heptagram-by-weekdays.png "Planetary hour calculator heptagram ordered by weekdays")

![Time Nomad planetary hour calculator heptagram ordered by hours](/images/features/time-nomad-features-planetary-hour-calculator-heptagram-by-hours.png "Planetary hour calculator heptagram ordered by hours")

## Chart of transits

---

**Chart of Transits** allows to explore current planetary configuration with respect to the personal natal chart.

![Time Nomad astrological chart of transits](/images/features/time-nomad-features-transits-chart.png "Chart of transits")

**Transits List** and **Transits Timeline** are similar to the above mentioned list of aspects and timeline of aspects views. 

![Time Nomad list of astrological transits](/images/features/time-nomad-features-transits-aspects.png "List of transits")

<div class="clearfix"></div>

**Transits Graph** screen is designed to focus on each natal planet (in the middle circle) with its natal aspects shown above the line and transiting aspects shown below the line.

![Time Nomad graph view of astrological transits](/images/features/time-nomad-features-transits-aspects-graph.png "Graph of transits")

Graph view unwraps the circle into a line segment covering (-180° … +180°] arc.

Markers plotted along the line show locations of exact aspects. Transiting planets on the left of those marks are approaching aspects, while planets on the right of the marks are separating. 


## <a name="progressions"></a>Chart of progressions

---

The idea behind progressions is to see how the natal chart develops throughout the years. Progressed chart is a natal chart moved forward one day for each year – 'a-day-for-a-year' progression. This technique is also known as *secondary progression*, *major progression* or *secondary direction*.

![Time Nomad astrological chart of secondary progressions](/images/features/time-nomad-features-progressions-chart.png "Chart of secondary progressions")

Time Nomad app settings allow to specify how the angles are progressed. The following methods are supported:

* True Solar arc in Longitude
* True Solar arc in Right Ascension
* Naibod in Right Ascension
* Naibod in Longitude

When in doubt, use True Solar arc in Longitude.

## Synastry charts

---

Synastry is analysis of two natal charts discovering relationships between the two. Time Nomad offers two ways of combining the charts with alignment by either Zodiac of the first house cusp.

![Time Nomad astrological chart of synastry](/images/features/time-nomad-features-synastry-chart.png "Chart of synastry between two natal charts")

**Composite chart of synastry** is a synthetic chart that is made by calculating midpoints between two natal charts. Having a composite chart presents an opportunity for transits analysis.

![Time Nomad astrological composite chart of synastry](/images/features/time-nomad-features-synastry-chart-transits.png "Composite chart of synastry")

![Time Nomad astrological transits of composite synastry chart](/images/features/time-nomad-features-synastry-chart-transits-aspects.png "Transits of composite synastry chart")

**Transits of the composite chart** can be analysed pretty much just like regular chart transits allowing to see the dynamics in the relationship between two natal charts.
